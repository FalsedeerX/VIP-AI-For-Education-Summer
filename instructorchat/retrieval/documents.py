For the second example, while they include the negative for the $$\delta_0$$, their weight update step is $$ w^{t +1}= w^t - \alpha * \delta_0 * x_i $$. Note the change in sign here - you will essentially be doing the same process, numerically but it&#39;s just that for the second example, the notation was changed.

Therefore, the print statement will be what is in the options. <br /><br />For Q2 - <br />The barbarian has 12 armor with 40 health. The wizard has 10 health, 20 power, 5 armor. The wizard attacks the barbarian - look at the attack() function in the wizard class; since the barbarian has 12 armor, the power of the wizard is doubled.

In the latter case, you would need to try out different values of k and see which one gives the lowest validation error. </p><p></p><p>The centers (or &#34;centroids&#34;) of the clusters are determined by the algorithm.

Since the performance of the algorithm does depend on the initialization, it is often a good idea to try several initializations.

L(x) is given as $$y - f(x)$$ so we take that partial derivative. dy is 0 so ignore that, so we have to do a derivative operation. (there is a derivative identity here, I call it derivative of the outside times derivative of the inside), so you get $$\frac{\partial f(w^T x)}{\partial w^T x}$$ and the derivative of the inside $$\frac{\partial w^T x}{\partial w_j}$$. technically, you don&#39;t need the first term with L(x) but that will give you the -1 term.so the equation becomes $$\frac{\partial f(w^T x)}{\partial w^T x}\frac{\partial w^T x}{\partial w_j}$$ which is $$\frac{\partial f(w^T x)}{\partial w^T x} = f(w^T x)(1-f(w^T x))$$ and $$\frac{\partial w^T x}{\partial w_j} = x_j$$. that gives you the first equation. Gradient descent starts at 0 and calculates the delta step so $$\nabla \frac{L(x)}{w_j}$$ at the 0th step is $$\delta_0$$ which is your step in the $$L(x)/w_j $$ direction. So a more formal way of writing the GD algo is $$ w-\alpha (\nabla \frac{L(x)}{w_j})*x$$ (make sure you actually calculate the dot product to see that it is zero) $$w^T x$$ which is $$1*2 + 2*2 + (-2*3) = 0$$.""", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Fall 2022 exam 3 doubt', 'timestamp': '2023-04-30T04:28:28Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['exam', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 141}),

Is this how the README was meant to be interpreted? If so, I don&#39;t understand why we would even bother evaluating the prediction accuracy on the entire dataset in the first place and not just the testing data. What is even the point of making us evaluate the entire dataset when we have trained the models on 60% of the set, it seems like it would make much more sense to just predict and evaluate on the testing data which the model has not seen.  Answer: According to step 3 of the readme:<br /><br />Get the predicted values of the model with the <strong>Test data, <br /><br /></strong>The test data is not poisoned. However, the data that is used to train the model is. What we want to do and observe is to see how the models do when they are trained on poisoned data and then evaluated on the same test data that was used in previous tests. Then you can draw conclusions on how the models responded with this added noise during the training process.

	Document(content="""Note: <p>This note contains useful information on Exam 3, in the form of FAQ. Check here periodically for updates.<br /><br /><strong>When/where is the exam?</strong><br />Friday, May 5, 1-2:05 PM in STEW 183.<strong></strong></p><p><strong><br />Is the exam coordinated for all four sections?</strong><br />Yes.</p><p><strong><br />What will be on the exam?</strong><br />There will be about 6 questions, covering weeks 12-16 of the course. Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics:</p><p></p><ul><li>kMeans clustering</li><li>Gaussian mixture models</li><li>Inheritance</li><li>kNN</li><li>Naïve Bayes</li><li>Logistic regression</li><li>Neural networks</li></ul><p><strong><br />What is the format/procedure of the exam?</strong></p><p>You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, <strong>it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet</strong>. This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every question. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page.</p><p><strong><br />What materials am I allowed to bring?</strong><br />Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are not allowed, but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance.</p><p><strong><br />What is the best way to study for the exam?</strong><br />Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homeworks that have been assigned so far. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace.</p><p><br />One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material.</p><p><strong><br />Will you take off points for syntax errors?</strong><br />If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax.</p><p><strong><br />What if I have a DRC accommodation?</strong><br />You should have already scheduled an exam with the DRC Testing Center. Please email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same.</p><p><strong><br />Any other logistics to be aware of?</strong><br />There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you. <strong>Please try to arrive 10-15 min early</strong> to have enough time to find an appropriate seat. </p>""", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Exam 3: FAQ', 'timestamp': '2023-04-21T22:20:25Z', 'user': 'ks3l0aykohs3yd', 'tags': ['exam', 'instructor-note', 'pin'], 'likes': 1, 'views': 360}),

However the z values that I am getting are very high which leads to a p value of 0 for all the bridges so I think i implementing something wrong. This is my code below.</p><p></p><pre>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.1, shuffle=False)regr = Ridge(fit_intercept=True,alpha=0)regr.fit(X_train,y_train)coef = regr.coef_[0][0]pred = regr.predict(X_test)r2 = r2_score(y_test,pred).round(4)standard_error = calc_std_error(X_train,y_train,regr)z_score = coef / (standard_error)p_value = 2*norm.cdf(-abs(z_score))p_values.append(p_value)def calc_std_error(X,y,model):    N = len(X)    mean = np.mean(X)        pred = np.array(model.predict(X))    pred = np.reshape(pred,(1,N))[0]    y = np.reshape(y,(1,N))[0]    X = np.reshape(X,(1,N))[0]    numerator = 0    for i in range(N):        numerator &#43;= (pred[i] - y[i])**2    numerator /= (N-2)    numerator = numerator ** 0.5    denominator = 0    for i in range(N):        denominator &#43;= (X[i] - mean)**2    denominator = denominator ** 0.5    std_error = numerator /denominator    return std_error</pre><p></p><p>I have implemented the hypothesis testing and standard error formula based on the ones given in the slides. I also thought that another way to approach this is to just get the r^2 value, based on the test data, for each bridge model and the lowest one would be the one to not get a sensor but I do not know if that is accepatable or not.</p><p></p><p>For question 2 I simply did lasso  ridge regression based on the specified features with the target features at varying lambda and found the lamda model with the smallest test mse and called it the best model. What I discovered however is the smaller the lambda I gave to the range of the lamda, the lowest one always was chosen as the best lambda which doesn&#39;t make sense as small lamda indicate over fitting. So is it plausible that no matter how small a lambda I input that it repeatedly gets lower and lower test mse?</p> Answer: hm that is a good find and a good point. To determine which bridges to install sensors on, I would recommend taking a more simple approach such as knowing sensors should be installed on those with more traffic, so possibly normalizing the data and calculating according to MSE. For part two I would recommend ignoring the extreme cases and trying to linear or ridge regression to find any sort of relationship.

But you only have enough budget to install sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should you install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall traffic?</li></ul><p>I understood the question to imply that they want the best 3 bridges that would offer the most reliable data or otherwise the data that is closest to the population parameters. So I thought that hypothesis testing would make sense and to see the z score of each bridge and compare them to each other. The bridges with the z score closest to the center of the gaussian distribution would be the most reliable. Assuming the population mean is the average of the mean of all bridges and same goes for the population variance.</p><p></p><p>For the second question,</p><ul><li>The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws, and wants to deploy police officers on days with high traffic to hand out citations. Can they use the next day&#39;s weather forecast(low/high temperature and precipitation) to predict the total number of bicyclists that day?</li></ul><p>I thought the best way to answer this question was to preform linear regression  using k-folds method with varying lambda and computing the average test MSE for each lambda and to see if the best model has a high enough r^2 score to be considered a valid estimator of the target value using the features mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Lastly for the third question,</p><ul dir='auto'><li>Can you use this data to predict what <em>day</em> (Monday to Sunday) is today based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?</li></ul><p>Again in a similar method to question 2, after converting the days of the week to numerical integer representation, apply linear regression using kfolds method with varying lambda and see if the best models r^2 value is good enough to say that the target value, the day of the week, can be predicted with the features, the total number of cyclists on the bridge.</p><p></p><p>Does this all sound like it would work or is there some flaw in the way I am applying any of the principles?</p> Answer: <p>For the final project, there are no benchmark-correct solutions, but your implementation should be not trivial. You can actually analyze if your solutions work. For example, in the first question, do you think your assumption is too strong? If you do a hypo test, what is the Null hypo? For the second question, a regression could be a good starting point. However, you really have to start to work on it to see what kind of regression gives you a good result. For the third one, you can try regression, but is there any other way that seems more appropriate (you only have 7 days, right)?</p>""", meta={'folders': ['project'], 'title': 'Approach to Path 2', 'timestamp': '2023-04-10T22:51:44Z', 'user': 'kz5ooutiquc22c', 'tags': ['project', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 17}),

Either the answer key is wrong or the `[]` are a typo.However, assuming `[\.edu]` should actually be `(\.edu)`, the third regex works as follows:*   The first part of the email address contains one or more lowercase letters (`[a-z]+`).*   The second part of the email address may contain zero or more digits (`[0-9]*`).*   The third part of the email address contains one or more upper/lowercase letters or hyphens (`[a-zA-Z\-]+`).*   The fourth part of the email address may contain the digit 2 (the `?` means the 2 is optional).*   The fifth part of the email address contains the `@` symbol.*   The sixth part of the email address contains one or more letters (both lowercase and uppercase) followed by a period (.) and the string “edu”.All of the email addresses match these criteria.EDIT: The reason `[a-z]+` and `[a-zA-Z\-]+` BOTH match is due to the `+` operator being “lazy but docile,” meaning it will match as much as possible, but reduce the length of its match to allow a future operator to find a match. Therefore `[a-z]+` won’t match the entirety of “darthvader” by itself, it also allows `[a-zA-Z\-]+` to match the string.</md>""", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Fall 2022 Q2B', 'timestamp': '2023-04-03T18:10:00Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['exam', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 120}),

	Document(content="""Question: <p>I understand what standard normalization does, but what is the practical use of it? Why should we apply standard normalization before doing regression? Is there any other reason to use standard normalization other than helping us to compare the coefficients of the regression model (say if I don&#39;t really care about the weights of the feature, is there any other use)? </p> Answer: <p>For the purposes of this class, the main use of normalization for regression is to put all explanatory variables in the same scale for interpretation purposes. If you chose not to do this, you would still get a valid regression model for prediction purposes. In fact, normalization does not change the Pearson correlation coefficient between explanatory variables at all.</p><p></p><p><strong>Supplementary 1:</strong> Beyond interpretation, normalization can sometimes have the benefit of improved numerical stability when you try to compute regression coefficients. Computers use floating point arithmetic to represent real numbers, so numbers that are very large or very small are not well-represented in the floating point system. Normalization can sometimes avoid this. This stability effect becomes much more important when training large-scale machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, where normalization is essential to avoid &#34;internal covariate shift&#34; during training.</p><p></p><p><strong>Supplementary 2: </strong>Another issue that comes up in high-dimensional regression problems is that of &#34;approximate multi-collinearity&#34;. This refers to situations where certain explanatory variables are almost perfectly explained by linear combinations of other variables. More advanced variants of normalization/standardization, such as &#34;principal component analysis&#34; (PCA), can be used before running regression to partially mitigate this issue. In fact, this flavor of regression has its own name--principal component regression (PCR).</p><p></p>""", meta={'folders': ['hw7'], 'title': 'What is the purpose of standard normalization', 'timestamp': '2023-03-21T19:03:54Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['hw7', 'student'], 'likes': 2, 'views': 127}),
	Document(content="""Note: <p>This note contains useful information on Exam 2, in the form of FAQ. Check here periodically for updates.<br /><br /><strong>When/where is the exam?</strong><br />Wednesday, April 5, 6:30-7:35 PM in <strong>four different rooms</strong>, as explained below: </p><ul><li>WALC 1055 --- Section 1 (Instructor: Mahsa Ghasemi)</li><li>FRNY G140 --- Section 2 (Instructor: Qiang Qiu)</li><li>BHEE 170 --- Section 3 (Instructor: Murat Kocaoglu)</li><li>ME 1061 --- Section 4 (Instructor: Anuran Makur)</li></ul><p>We will check the collected exams to make sure you were in the correct room. </p><p><strong><br />Is the exam coordinated for all four sections?</strong><br />Yes.</p><p><strong><br />What will be on the exam?</strong><br />There will be about 6 questions, covering weeks 6-12 of the course. Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics:</p><p></p><ul><li>Confidence intervals</li><li>Student’s t-distribution and t-tests</li><li>Regular expressions in Python</li><li>Linear regression, least squares equations, and evaluation metrics</li><li>Regularization and ridge regression</li><li>Cross validation</li><li>n-grams and tf-idf</li><li>Objects and classes</li></ul><p><strong><br />What is the format/procedure of the exam?</strong></p><p>You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, <strong>it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet</strong>. This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every question. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page.</p><p><strong><br />What materials am I allowed to bring?</strong><br />Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are not allowed, but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance.</p><p><strong><br />What is the best way to study for the exam?</strong><br />Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homeworks that have been assigned so far. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace.</p><p><br />One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material.</p><p><strong><br />Will you take off points for syntax errors?</strong><br />If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax.</p><p><strong><br />What if I have a DRC accommodation?</strong><br />Please schedule an exam with the DRC Testing Center, and email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same.</p><p></p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Students have until <strong>11:55 PM seven days before an exam</strong> to submit a request to the DRC Testing Center. <br /><br /><strong>Additional Note: </strong>The students need to submit all <strong>final exam</strong> requests to the DRC Testing Center before <strong>11:55 PM on April 7</strong>. </p><p><strong><br />Any other logistics to be aware of?</strong><br />There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you. <strong>Please try to arrive 10-15 min early</strong> to have enough time to find an appropriate seat. </p>""", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Exam 2: FAQ', 'timestamp': '2023-03-21T18:32:55Z', 'user': 'ks3l0aykohs3yd', 'tags': ['exam', 'instructor-note', 'pin'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 379}),

	Document(content="""Question: <p>Why is there a determinant of zero, causing an error in the np inverse function, when I take the feature matrix X and perform the operation X.T @ X, but there is not when I do X @ X.T. In the formula, the part in parentheses is X^(T) X, so I assumed it is necessary to perform the operation X.T @ X but that does not work. Is X @ X.T fine, and if so why is the formula written that way?</p> Answer: <p>I am not sure which problem you are referring to, so I&#39;ll answer the question in general. X^T X is usually not equal to X X^T, so the least-squares formula only works with X^T X (assuming the rows of the matrix are sample feature vectors followed by 1). The derivation of the formula is given in the regression slides, so I suggest you take a closer look at that to understand it. Since a matrix is non-singular (i.e., inverse exists) if and only if its determinant is non-zero, you must be in a situation where X^T X is singular. If you have come across a least-squares regression problem where X^T X is singular, then the closed-form formula in the slides will not work, and you need to use more advanced methods like pseudo-inversion to get a solution. However, none of this necessarily implies that X X^T must be singular.</p><p></p><p>Recall from the slides that X^T X is non-singular if and only if the columns of X are linearly independent. On the other hand, we can infer from the slides that X X^T is non-singular if and only if the rows of X are linearly independent. It is possible to have matrices X with: 1) linearly <strong>in</strong>dependent columns and linearly dependent rows, 2) linearly <strong>in</strong>dependent rows and linearly dependent columns, 3) linearly <strong>in</strong>dependent rows and linearly <strong>in</strong>dependent columns, and 4) linearly dependent rows and linearly dependent columns. (You should try to construct examples to convince yourself.) Hence, we can have matrices X satisfying four possibilities, respectively: 1) X^T X is non-singular and X X^T is singular, 2) X^T X is singular and X X^T is non-singular, 3) X^T X and X X^T are both non-singular, and 4) X^T X and X X^T are both singular.</p>""", meta={'folders': ['hw7'], 'title': 'Matrix Algebra', 'timestamp': '2023-03-12T02:05:59Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['hw7', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 151}),

The layout of this exam was horrendously different. Around 2 of the questions in the previous exams were fill in the blanks or multiple choice, the next 2 or 3 were simple scripts with some more niche topics i.e. list comprehension, and the last 1 or 2 were graphing/testing process questions. We had no multiple choice or fill in the blanks (i.e. what is the output if...), the short scripts were far more complex in logic, and there were barely any actual graphing/testing/sampling questions. Questions 5 and 6 were entirely out of the scope of anything taught to us, aside from the basic concepts. Having an entire multi-part question based around a niche function was an atrocious decision, and not consistent with topics covered in lecture. If we were expected to know the map() function so well, there should have been a lecture dedicated to that function alone. This exam horribly tested our knowledge of the past 6 weeks&#39; content. Previous exams covered nearly every topic to a decent extent; this exam covered very few topics complexly to an indescribable extent.</p> Answer: <p>Yep, that was ridiculous.

	Document(content="""Question: I really don&#39;t get what this question is doing. I saw that X = -Y means that the realization of Y is the negative of the realization of X. But what does that mean? Does that mean that if X happens, Y doesn&#39;t happen, and if X doesn&#39;t happen, Y happens? Answer: <p>Informally, a random variable is as a mathematical object that can take different values with different probabilities depending on the outcome of a statistical experiment. There is no notion of a random variable &#34;happening&#34;. In probability theory, &#34;events&#34; can happen or not happen. Random variables are merely useful constructs (technically, functions from the sample space to real numbers) to define collections of numerical events to which we can assign probabilities. </p><p></p><p>But all the abstractness aside, let me try to explain this with an example. Let X be a random variable which represents the outcome of a dice throw. Then, X can take the possible values {1,2,3,4,5,6}, and X takes each of these values with probability 1/6. When the dice is thrown (i.e., the statistical experiment is run), we see a particular &#34;realization&#34; of the random variable, e.g., {X = 4} if the dice came out 4. This means that the event {X = 4} happened. The probability of this event is P(X = 4) = 1/6, and such probabilities make up the PMF of the random variable (because the random variable is discrete in this example). When we define Y = -X, we are constructing a new random variable Y which takes the possible values {-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6}, and in particular, {Y = -j} if and only if {X = j} for j = 1,2,3,4,5,6. This means that when X has realization 4 (i.e., the event {X = 4} occurs), Y has realization -4 (i.e., the event {Y = -4} also occurs). Moreover, the probability P(Y = -4) = P(X = 4) = 1/6. </p>""", meta={'folders': ['hw5'], 'title': 'HW5, Q1B', 'timestamp': '2023-02-21T19:52:04Z', 'user': 'klh98pfz6y127s', 'tags': ['hw5', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 133}),

	Document(content="""Question: <p>To my understanding, we are trying to make the z-score bigger to make the null hypothesis less probable. You can increase n or decrease variance to make z-bigger. However, if you increase n doesn&#39;t that make xbar approach the true mean because of the central limit theorem which would make the null hypothesis more probable? In that case, wouldn&#39;t decreasing n mean there is a greater chance xbar is farther away from mu?</p> Answer: <p>This is a great question. For the purposes of the Fall 22 exam, the question implicitly assumes that all other parameters are held constant when a particular parameter is changed. So, xbar is held constant as n is increased. In this case, the z-score would indeed increase with larger n since the standard error reduces. This explains the official solution, and this is what you should assume unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, your observation is also partly correct. If we do not fix xbar, then as n increases, xbar tends to the population mean mu (due to the law of large numbers). However, this does not allow us to easily conclude that the null hypothesis is more or less probable, because both |xbar - mu| and the standard error are decreasing as n increases, so it is not obvious what happens to the z-score based solely on the formula for z-score. In fact, |xbar - mu| is technically a random variable, so one needs to carefully define what &#34;decreasing&#34; even means in this scenario. If you go through the exercise of rigorously doing the calculations, you&#39;ll see that in some &#34;average&#34; sense, |xbar - mu| decays at the &#34;same rate&#34; as the standard error. This is precisely why we can even have a central limit theorem where the Z-variable is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1.

	Document(content="""Note: <p>This note contains useful information on Exam 1, in the form of FAQ. Check here periodically for updates.<br /><br /><strong>When/where is the exam?</strong><br />Wednesday, February 22, 6:30-7:35 PM in <strong>two different rooms</strong>, as explained below: </p><ul><li>WTHR 200 --- Section 1 (Instructor: Mahsa Ghasemi) and Section 2 (Instructor: Qiang Qiu) </li><li>BHEE 129 --- Section 3 (Instructor: Murat Kocaoglu) and Section 4 (Instructor: Anuran Makur)</li></ul><p>We will check the collected exams to make sure you were in the correct room.</p><p><strong><br />Is the exam coordinated for all four sections?</strong><br />Yes.</p><p><strong><br />What will be on the exam?</strong><br />There will be about 6 questions, covering weeks 1-6 of the course. Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics:</p><p></p><ul><li>Python data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)</li><li>Basic Python operations (e.g., loops, arithmetic, manipulating data structures)</li><li>Functions and higher order functions in Python</li><li>List comprehensions in Python</li><li>Histograms</li><li>Random variables and probability distributions</li><li>Sampling, the law of large numbers, and the central limit theorem</li><li>Hypothesis testing</li></ul><p><strong><br />What is the format/procedure of the exam?</strong></p><p>You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, <strong>it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet</strong>. This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every question. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page.</p><p><strong><br />What materials am I allowed to bring?</strong><br />Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are not allowed, but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance.</p><p><strong><br />What is the best way to study for the exam?</strong><br />Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homeworks that have been assigned so far. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace.</p><p><br />One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material.</p><p><strong><br />Will you take off points for syntax errors?</strong><br />If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax.</p><p><strong><br />What if I have a DRC accommodation?</strong><br />Please schedule an exam with the DRC Testing Center, and email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same.</p><p></p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Students have until <strong>11:55 PM seven days before an exam</strong> to submit a request to the DRC Testing Center.</p><p><strong><br />Any other logistics to be aware of?</strong><br />There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you. <strong>Please try to arrive 10-15 min early</strong> to have enough time to find an appropriate seat. </p>""", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Exam 1: FAQ', 'timestamp': '2023-02-07T20:31:41Z', 'user': 'ks3l0aykohs3yd', 'tags': ['exam', 'instructor-note', 'pin'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 392}),
	Document(content="""Question: <p>I understand a stencil function slides across a list, and whatever the result of the function is will get placed into a new list.</p><p></p><p>But for this function in Problem 2, it is taking the sum of all the data in the list and dividing it by 3.
