The Google form indicating your team details was not completed. Please be aware that in instances where both team members submitted the report on Gradescope, we have solely graded one person's report to avoid duplication. In the event that you received an extension approved by the instructor and still find your Mini Project grade has been penalized, kindly submit a regrade request.

For the loss function in the second function that partial derivative is just -1 which is the first term in the expression for $$ \delta_0$$ Edit: Sorry for the misunderstanding - I think this is a matter of notation here. In the slides, $$ \delta_0$$ does not have the negative and for the weight update step, you do $$ w^{t +1}= w^t + \alpha * \delta_0 * x_i $$. For the second example, while they include the negative for the $$\delta_0$$, their weight update step is $$ w^{t +1}= w^t - \alpha * \delta_0 * x_i $$. Note the change in sign here - you will essentially be doing the same process, numerically but it's just that for the second example, the notation was changed.

Answer: As the student answer says, the heights of the distributions are scaled by the weights $$ \pi_1 $$ and $$ \pi_2$$.

	Document(content="Question: Can someone explain how they get the 0.5 in these equations? Answer: Referring to the gradient ascent and logistic regression slidedeck, the gradient ascent equation is (for 1 iteration) $$ \beta_j^{t+1} = \beta_j^t + \alpha * \sum_1^n {(y_i - f_{\beta}(x_i)) x_{ij}}$$ Here, $$\beta_j$$ is the the coefficient of jth feature (and $$\beta_0$$ is the constant in the regression), n is the number of datapoints, $$\alpha$$ is the step size, t - the iteration and f is the logistic regression equation. Note that $$x_{ij}$$ refers to the jth feature of the ith point. So in this question, x has 2 features - the age ($$x_1$$)and the length of stay ($$x_2$$) $$ f_{\beta}(x) = \frac{1}{1+exp(-(-3 + 0.1x_1 - 1*x_2))} $$ So, you know that in this case, $$ \beta_0 = -3, \beta_1 = 0.1$$ and$$ \beta_2 = -1$$. So in our case right now, we have only 1 points to consider, so we are going to have n = 1. Now for the gradient ascent, For $$\beta_0$$ (this is the constant, so $$x_{ij}$$ = 1)we have - $$ \beta_0^{t+1} = \beta_0^t + \alpha * {(y - f_{\beta}(x)) * 1}$$ For $$\beta_1$$ we have - $$ \beta_1^{t+1} = \beta_1^t + \alpha * {(y - f_{\beta}(x)) x_{1}}$$ For $$\beta_2$$ we have - $$ \beta_2^{t+1} = \beta_2^t + \alpha* {(y - f_{\beta}(x)) x_{2}}$$ The logistic function is $$ f_{\beta}(x) = \frac{1}{1+exp(-(-3 + 0.1x_1 - 1*x_2))} $$, which will evaluate to $$ f_{\beta}(x) = \frac{1}{1+exp(-(-3 + 0.1*0 - 1*(-3)))} = 0.5 $$ when you consider the data point stated in the question (when the age is 0, and the length of stay is -3). The y (cancel/not cancel) is stated to be 1. So our gradient ascent equation is now: For $$\beta_0$$ (the constant term)we have - $$ \beta_0^{t+1} = (-3) + \alpha * {(1 - 0.5) * 1}$$ For $$\beta_1$$ (the age coefficient)we have - $$ \beta_1^{t+1} = 0.1+ \alpha * {(1 - 0.5) * 0}$$ For $$\beta_2$$ (the length of stay coefficient)we have - $$ \beta_2^{t+1} = -1 + \alpha * {(1 - 0.5) * (-3)}$$ ", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Fall 2022 Final 4C', 'timestamp': '2023-05-02T02:08:56Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['exam', 'student'], 'likes': 1, 'views': 119}),

	Document(content="Question: Dear Jason, I wanted to follow up on your note saying that the lead UTA misspoke when she told me a Jupyter notebook submission was fine. Before I made my original post I already tried moving everything over into a regular .py file and I encountered a bunch of minor errors. After spending a couple hours trying to debug them I figured that it wasn't worth it and I should make a post on Piazza asking if I could submit a Jupyter notebook. I made this post 5 days ago because I saw in the instructions it said to submit a .py file. Since I never received a response until now, I brought it up at the helproom and I specifically mentioned that the instructions say that we needed to submit a .py file. Here are the main errors I was dealing with: The first one is with matplotlib.pyplot.clf. This method should clear an entire figure before plotting a new one. I'm not sure why but when I call it after generating a figure with subplots it doesn't work. Instead, my next plot gets plotted over the last subplot. This shown in the following screenshot. Its hard to tell but my histogram gets put on the subplot at the end. Screenshot_2023-04-30_at_7.57.15_PM.png What I've tried to debug this: - Using axs.clf, fig.clf instead of plt.clf - Switching the figure before each plot with plt.figure(x) - Calling plt.clf more than once in between those two figures The next error is with plt.savefig cutting off my labels when it saves the figure. Not sure how to go about fixing this. My code is too long to submit screenshots of so I pushed the .py file with these errors to my repository. Could you please take a look at it? Also, may I ask why Jupyter notebooks are not allowed? Answer: About your first error, the error might stem from Line 58 of your .py where you have plt.clf instead of plt.clf().

	Document(content="Question: When doing kmeans how do you know how many groups you should make and where the centers should be? I'm kinda confused on this specifically im using it for path 1. Answer: The number of clusters for k-means clustering, i.e., the value of k, is either clear from context, e.g., k = 2 if you want to interpret the clusters as 2 classes, or it needs to be determined using cross-validation techniques. In the latter case, you would need to try out different values of k and see which one gives the lowest validation error. The centers (or 'centroids') of the clusters are determined by the algorithm. So, you do not need to know where the final centers are a priori. Of course, you do need to initialize the algorithm with some centers. This center initialization is arbitrary, e.g., randomly generate centers. Since the performance of the algorithm does depend on the initialization, it is often a good idea to try several initializations. Python libraries have inputs that allow you to control number of initializations, or even utilize more advanced initialization methods such as kmeans++ (kmeans++ will not be tested in your exam).

	Document(content="Question: Can anyone explain what are we doing here? Thanks. Answer: L(x) is given to you, so to find the partial derivative$$\frac{\partial L(x)}{\partial w_j}$$ we need to take the partial derivative. L(x) is given as $$y - f(x)$$ so we take that partial derivative. dy is 0 so ignore that, so we have to do a derivative operation. (there is a derivative identity here, I call it derivative of the outside times derivative of the inside), so you get $$\frac{\partial f(w^T x)}{\partial w^T x}$$ and the derivative of the inside $$\frac{\partial w^T x}{\partial w_j}$$. technically, you don't need the first term with L(x) but that will give you the -1 term.so the equation becomes $$\frac{\partial f(w^T x)}{\partial w^T x}\frac{\partial w^T x}{\partial w_j}$$ which is $$\frac{\partial f(w^T x)}{\partial w^T x} = f(w^T x)(1-f(w^T x))$$ and $$\frac{\partial w^T x}{\partial w_j} = x_j$$. that gives you the first equation. Gradient descent starts at 0 and calculates the delta step so $$\nabla \frac{L(x)}{w_j}$$ at the 0th step is $$\delta_0$$ which is your step in the $$L(x)/w_j $$ direction. So a more formal way of writing the GD algo is $$ w-\alpha (\nabla \frac{L(x)}{w_j})*x$$ (make sure you actually calculate the dot product to see that it is zero) $$w^T x$$ which is $$1*2 + 2*2 + (-2*3) = 0$$.", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Fall 2022 exam 3 doubt', 'timestamp': '2023-04-30T04:28:28Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['exam', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 141}),

	Document(content="Question: I was wondering if this was a valid analysis method to follow, since it wasn't discussed in class and is a bit rudimentary for path 2 problem 1. It follows that the best way to determine the answer is to find the two bridges with the most similar traffic patterns and only apply a sensor to one of these two in order to approximate the overall traffic. To do this, we can first create bridge pairs. For simplicity, Brooklyn Bridge will be labeled as bridge 1, Manhattan Bridge will be labeled as bridge 2, Williamsburg Bridge will be labeled as bridge 3, and Queensboro Bridge will be labeled as bridge 4. These pairs are listed below:  Bridges 1 and 2 Bridges 1 and 3 Bridges 1 and 4 Bridges 2 and 3 Bridges 2 and 4 Bridges 3 and 4  For each bridge pair, we can calculate the difference in bike traffic for each day, and compute the average difference in bike traffic by summing the differences and dividing by the total number of data points. The pair of bridges with the lowest average difference can be considered as being the most similar, and the bridge with the greater average traffic will be fitted with a sensor, along with the two bridges that were not included in the pair. Answer: That looks like a valid approach, seems like you are using MSE to evaluate the models, maybe try normalizing the data first.

	Document(content="Note: This note contains useful information on Exam 3, in the form of FAQ. Check here periodically for updates. When/where is the exam? Friday, May 5, 1-2:05 PM in STEW 183. Is the exam coordinated for all four sections? Yes. What will be on the exam? There will be about 6 questions, covering weeks 12-16 of the course. Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics: kMeans clustering Gaussian mixture models Inheritance kNN Naïve Bayes Logistic regression Neural networks What is the format/procedure of the exam? You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet . This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every question. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page. What materials am I allowed to bring? Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are not allowed, but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance. What is the best way to study for the exam? Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homeworks that have been assigned so far. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace. One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material. Will you take off points for syntax errors? If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax. What if I have a DRC accommodation? You should have already scheduled an exam with the DRC Testing Center. Please email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same. Any other logistics to be aware of? There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you. Please try to arrive 10-15 min early to have enough time to find an appropriate seat.

I was thinking that I could compare the different methods and state that Naive Bayes works the best. Does these results look reasonable? I have more confusion matricies, but I commented them out for this picture. Thank you Answer: Your methods and results look reasonable to me - as for the conclusions you can draw - you can think about the original question - can you predict the day from the number of cyclists? In your project report, you can document your usage of these methods as well as the results that you have obtained along with the accuracy of these methods. While you can state that the Naive Bayes classifier works the best, it is also important to ask yourself - is an accuracy of 20.9% sufficient to predict the day from the number of cyclists? If you think that is a reasonable accuracy, you can justify why you can use the Naive Bayes method to predict days from cyclists. If that is an accuracy you think is not reasonable, you can also say that you cannot predict what day it is just from the number of cyclists alone (with justification, of course!).

	Document(content="Question: I have started writing the code for the mini project and ran into some conceptual problems, specifically for question 1 and 2 of path 2. For question 1, I had thought to approach it by preforming linear regression for each bridge data with the total number of cyclists as the target value and then preforming hypothesis testing on the coefficient associated for each bridge in their respective model and the bridge with the lowest P value would be the one that should not receive a sensor. However the z values that I am getting are very high which leads to a p value of 0 for all the bridges so I think i implementing something wrong. This is my code below. X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.1, shuffle=False)regr = Ridge(fit_intercept=True,alpha=0)regr.fit(X_train,y_train)coef = regr.coef_[0][0]pred = regr.predict(X_test)r2 = r2_score(y_test,pred).round(4)standard_error = calc_std_error(X_train,y_train,regr)z_score = coef / (standard_error)p_value = 2*norm.cdf(-abs(z_score))p_values.append(p_value)def calc_std_error(X,y,model): N = len(X) mean = np.mean(X) pred = np.array(model.predict(X)) pred = np.reshape(pred,(1,N))[0] y = np.reshape(y,(1,N))[0] X = np.reshape(X,(1,N))[0] numerator = 0 for i in range(N): numerator += (pred[i] - y[i])**2 numerator /= (N-2) numerator = numerator ** 0.5 denominator = 0 for i in range(N): denominator += (X[i] - mean)**2 denominator = denominator ** 0.5 std_error = numerator /denominator return std_error I have implemented the hypothesis testing and standard error formula based on the ones given in the slides. I also thought that another way to approach this is to just get the r^2 value, based on the test data, for each bridge model and the lowest one would be the one to not get a sensor but I do not know if that is accepatable or not. For question 2 I simply did lasso ridge regression based on the specified features with the target features at varying lambda and found the lamda model with the smallest test mse and called it the best model. What I discovered however is the smaller the lambda I gave to the range of the lamda, the lowest one always was chosen as the best lambda which doesn't make sense as small lamda indicate over fitting. So is it plausible that no matter how small a lambda I input that it repeatedly gets lower and lower test mse? Answer: hm that is a good find and a good point. To determine which bridges to install sensors on, I would recommend taking a more simple approach such as knowing sensors should be installed on those with more traffic, so possibly normalizing the data and calculating according to MSE. For part two I would recommend ignoring the extreme cases and trying to linear or ridge regression to find any sort of relationship.

	Document(content="Question: I started planning how I am going to answer the questions proposed for path 2 of the project and I have a methodology to obtain the answer of each question. However, before I start coding and implementing the solution, I wanted to make sure that my plan makes sense. So for the first question, You want to install sensors on the bridges to estimate overall traffic across all the bridges. But you only have enough budget to install sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should you install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall traffic? I understood the question to imply that they want the best 3 bridges that would offer the most reliable data or otherwise the data that is closest to the population parameters. So I thought that hypothesis testing would make sense and to see the z score of each bridge and compare them to each other. The bridges with the z score closest to the center of the gaussian distribution would be the most reliable. Assuming the population mean is the average of the mean of all bridges and same goes for the population variance. For the second question, The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws, and wants to deploy police officers on days with high traffic to hand out citations. Can they use the next day's weather forecast(low/high temperature and precipitation) to predict the total number of bicyclists that day? I thought the best way to answer this question was to preform linear regression using k-folds method with varying lambda and computing the average test MSE for each lambda and to see if the best model has a high enough r^2 score to be considered a valid estimator of the target value using the features mentioned. Lastly for the third question, Can you use this data to predict what day (Monday to Sunday) is today based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges? Again in a similar method to question 2, after converting the days of the week to numerical integer representation, apply linear regression using kfolds method with varying lambda and see if the best models r^2 value is good enough to say that the target value, the day of the week, can be predicted with the features, the total number of cyclists on the bridge. Does this all sound like it would work or is there some flaw in the way I am applying any of the principles? Answer: For the final project, there are no benchmark-correct solutions, but your implementation should be not trivial. You can actually analyze if your solutions work. For example, in the first question, do you think your assumption is too strong? If you do a hypo test, what is the Null hypo? For the second question, a regression could be a good starting point. However, you really have to start to work on it to see what kind of regression gives you a good result. For the third one, you can try regression, but is there any other way that seems more appropriate (you only have 7 days, right)?

I thought they changed it so it was one or the other? And that if you have a final exam you cannot have work due during dead week? Answer: I'd guess the alternative was likely cutting a week off how long you have to work on the final project and making it due the 21st or 23rd. If I were you I would just treat it as if it was due the 21st and then have dead week to work if you don't get it done.

Answer: A confidence interval is a range around a sample statistic that gives you the values of the population parameter for which the sample statistic would not be surprising. Think of it as doing the opposite of hypothesis testing. 1 - C gives you the p-value. You use the p-value to calculate the z-score and you use the z-score to formulate lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval. It is just saying that if you did hypothesis testing assuming one of the values inside the confidence interval as the population parameter, you would get a p-value that would be greater than or equal to 1 - C. It doesn't really tell you a lot in my opinion. For the second question, if you decrease the percentage, you would increase the p - value, which would decrease the z-score, which would result in a narrower confidence interval. For the third question, the same thing as the second question but they also change the n and sigma. So, in that case, you need to know by how much do n and sigma change to know how the c.i. range changes.

I assume because this dataset takes the best fit shape of a third degree polynomial, but I’d like to understand this problem deeper. If for example they said “assume we require a2>a3>a1>a0” would the best fit data set be one that matches a second degree polynomial? Answer: If a3>a2>a1>a0, that means the cubic coefficient will be greatest, so you would look for a dataset that appears most cubic. Now, if we knew a3<a2<.1, and that a1>a0>100, we’d probably have a good idea we are looking for a linear dataset, because the cubic/quadratic coefficients are so much lower.

The slides didn't specifically point which one we should pick. Answer: The purpose of cross-validation is not to pick one model out of the k models; it is to test how good the method you are using is. The performance of the model from cross validation will be the average MSE of the k different models that you have trained in the cross validation process. Once the validation process is done, there is no need for any of these k models because the purpose of cross validation is to get an idea of how good a particular method is. Here's an example - let's say you have two different methods you are using to solve a problem - let's say one is a linear regression model and the other is a neural network. One of the ways you can do to determine which method is better is you can do a k-fold cross validation of both the linear regression model and the neural network method.

Either the answer key is wrong or the `[]` are a typo.However, assuming `[\.edu]` should actually be `(\.edu)`, the third regex works as follows:* The first part of the email address contains one or more lowercase letters (`[a-z]+`).* The second part of the email address may contain zero or more digits (`[0-9]*`).* The third part of the email address contains one or more upper/lowercase letters or hyphens (`[a-zA-Z\-]+`).* The fourth part of the email address may contain the digit 2 (the `?` means the 2 is optional).* The fifth part of the email address contains the `@` symbol.* The sixth part of the email address contains one or more letters (both lowercase and uppercase) followed by a period (.) and the string “edu”.All of the email addresses match these criteria.EDIT: The reason `[a-z]+` and `[a-zA-Z\-]+` BOTH match is due to the `+` operator being “lazy but docile,” meaning it will match as much as possible, but reduce the length of its match to allow a future operator to find a match. Therefore `[a-z]+` won’t match the entirety of “darthvader” by itself, it also allows `[a-zA-Z\-]+` to match the string.

	Document(content="Note: Hello Everyone, The final project has been released on GitHub Classroom and is due on April 30, 2023, 11:59 pm ET. This project is designed to put your knowledge of data analysis to use, where you will be given a dataset and asked to draw conclusions from it. You will need to understand what the data is showing you, design the analyses you need, justify those choices, draw conclusions from running the analyses, and explain why they do (or do not) make sense. Mini Project: https://classroom.github.com/a/SM8Fi8N8 There are three possible paths to choose from, and you may work with one partner (from the same section) if you wish. Working with a partner is optional and will not impact how the project is graded. If you decide to work with a partner, please remember that only one of the two members, i.e., the team-lead, needs to submit the completed code and PDF report. To collaboratively work on this project, the team-lead could add the other member as a collaborator to his/her repository, however, that is completely optional. Also, please make sure to fill out this form ( https://forms.gle/ytT2u8eGukddJ9XA9 ) and follow the instructions given in the project description on GitHub Classroom. To look for teammates you could use the 'Search for Teammates!' post on Piazza : https://piazza.com/class/lcj9rez4czg6zj/post/5 In a week's time, you will have the Mini Project submission portal live on Gradescope. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to come to office hours to brainstorm or use Piazza to discuss with your peers. Best of luck with your final project!

	Document(content="Question: I understand what standard normalization does, but what is the practical use of it? Why should we apply standard normalization before doing regression? Is there any other reason to use standard normalization other than helping us to compare the coefficients of the regression model (say if I don't really care about the weights of the feature, is there any other use)? Answer: For the purposes of this class, the main use of normalization for regression is to put all explanatory variables in the same scale for interpretation purposes. If you chose not to do this, you would still get a valid regression model for prediction purposes. In fact, normalization does not change the Pearson correlation coefficient between explanatory variables at all. Supplementary 1: Beyond interpretation, normalization can sometimes have the benefit of improved numerical stability when you try to compute regression coefficients. Computers use floating point arithmetic to represent real numbers, so numbers that are very large or very small are not well-represented in the floating point system. Normalization can sometimes avoid this. This stability effect becomes much more important when training large-scale machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, where normalization is essential to avoid 'internal covariate shift' during training. Supplementary 2: Another issue that comes up in high-dimensional regression problems is that of 'approximate multi-collinearity'. This refers to situations where certain explanatory variables are almost perfectly explained by linear combinations of other variables. More advanced variants of normalization/standardization, such as 'principal component analysis' (PCA), can be used before running regression to partially mitigate this issue. In fact, this flavor of regression has its own name--principal component regression (PCR).

	Document(content="Note: This note contains useful information on Exam 2, in the form of FAQ. Check here periodically for updates. When/where is the exam? Wednesday, April 5, 6:30-7:35 PM in four different rooms , as explained below: WALC 1055 --- Section 1 (Instructor: Mahsa Ghasemi) FRNY G140 --- Section 2 (Instructor: Qiang Qiu) BHEE 170 --- Section 3 (Instructor: Murat Kocaoglu) ME 1061 --- Section 4 (Instructor: Anuran Makur) We will check the collected exams to make sure you were in the correct room. Is the exam coordinated for all four sections? Yes. What will be on the exam? There will be about 6 questions, covering weeks 6-12 of the course. Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics: Confidence intervals Student’s t-distribution and t-tests Regular expressions in Python Linear regression, least squares equations, and evaluation metrics Regularization and ridge regression Cross validation n-grams and tf-idf Objects and classes What is the format/procedure of the exam? You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet . This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every question. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page. What materials am I allowed to bring? Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are not allowed, but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance. What is the best way to study for the exam? Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homeworks that have been assigned so far. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace. One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material. Will you take off points for syntax errors? If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax. What if I have a DRC accommodation? Please schedule an exam with the DRC Testing Center, and email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same. Note: Students have until 11:55 PM seven days before an exam to submit a request to the DRC Testing Center. Additional Note: The students need to submit all final exam requests to the DRC Testing Center before 11:55 PM on April 7 . Any other logistics to be aware of?

	Document(content="Question: Why is there a determinant of zero, causing an error in the np inverse function, when I take the feature matrix X and perform the operation X.T @ X, but there is not when I do X @ X.T. In the formula, the part in parentheses is X^(T) X, so I assumed it is necessary to perform the operation X.T @ X but that does not work. Is X @ X.T fine, and if so why is the formula written that way? Answer: I am not sure which problem you are referring to, so I'll answer the question in general. X^T X is usually not equal to X X^T, so the least-squares formula only works with X^T X (assuming the rows of the matrix are sample feature vectors followed by 1). The derivation of the formula is given in the regression slides, so I suggest you take a closer look at that to understand it. Since a matrix is non-singular (i.e., inverse exists) if and only if its determinant is non-zero, you must be in a situation where X^T X is singular. If you have come across a least-squares regression problem where X^T X is singular, then the closed-form formula in the slides will not work, and you need to use more advanced methods like pseudo-inversion to get a solution. However, none of this necessarily implies that X X^T must be singular. Recall from the slides that X^T X is non-singular if and only if the columns of X are linearly independent. On the other hand, we can infer from the slides that X X^T is non-singular if and only if the rows of X are linearly independent. It is possible to have matrices X with: 1) linearly in dependent columns and linearly dependent rows, 2) linearly in dependent rows and linearly dependent columns, 3) linearly in dependent rows and linearly in dependent columns, and 4) linearly dependent rows and linearly dependent columns. (You should try to construct examples to convince yourself.) Hence, we can have matrices X satisfying four possibilities, respectively: 1) X^T X is non-singular and X X^T is singular, 2) X^T X is singular and X X^T is non-singular, 3) X^T X and X X^T are both non-singular, and 4) X^T X and X X^T are both singular.

Answer: If you are having difficulty seeing overlapping lines, you can try modifying the line thicknesses or other attributes using Matplotlib.

	Document(content="Question: I am confused on what exactly the feature matrix is: I understand it has the coefficients its format should be matrix = [# samples][degrees + 1] but I am do not understand the purpose of the feature matrix is or how we would calculate the values in it. Answer: Given samples $$x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_n $$ and their corresponding $$ y_1, y_2, ... , y_n $$ and let's say you want to fit it to a polynomial of degree $$ d $$. Let's say this polynomial of best fit is $$ y = a_d x^d + a_{d-1} x^{d-1} + ... + a_0$$. The feature matrix is used to find the coefficients $$ a_d, a_{d-1}, a_{d-2}, ..., a_0 $$. In this case the feature matrix will be: $$ X = \begin{bmatrix} {x_1}^d & {x_1}^{d-1} & {x_1}^{d-2} ... &x_1& 1 \\ {x_2}^d & {x_2}^{d-1} & {x_2}^{d-2} ... &x_2& 1 \\ &... & & \\ & & & \\ {x_n}^d & {x_n}^{d-1} & {x_n}^{d-2} ... &x_n& 1 \\ \end{bmatrix} $$ The coefficients will then be: Here X is the feature matrix, and $$ y = \begin{bmatrix} {y_1}\\ {y_2}\\ {y_3}\\ ... \\ \\ {y_n} \\ \end{bmatrix} $$, $$ \beta = \begin{bmatrix} {a_d}\\ {a_{d-1}}\\ {a_{d-2}}\\ ... \\ \\ {a_0} \\ \end{bmatrix} $$. Let's consider this example for the feature matrix: [$$x_1, x_2, x_3 $$] = [1,2,3] and let's say the polynomial we want to fit it to is quadratic (the degree, d, is 2). Then the feature matrix will be: $$ X = \begin{bmatrix} 1^2 & 1^1 & 1^0 \\ 2^2& 2^1 & 2^0 \\ 3^2&3^1 &3^0 \\ \end{bmatrix} $$ The feature matrix should have the size (# of datapoints) x (degree + 1). Each row of the feature matrix corresponds to one point of data from x, and each column corresponds to a certain degree value, starting at the highest degree and going to 0, so the last column of the feature matrix is filled with all 1's. CAVEAT: The formula for $$\beta$$ above only holds when the columns of the feature matrix $$X$$ are linearly independent. To ensure this, we must have that $$ d + 1 \leq n$$ and at least $$d +1$$ of the explanatory variable samples $$x_1,\dots,x_n$$ are distinct.

I really believe that this exam should be analyzed by course coordinators. Let me know how we can expect this to affect our final grade. Answer: I agree. I was genuinely interested in this class as nearly every concept applies to machine learning, from data sampling to NumPy usage, and it's a field that greatly interests me.

I felt great and well prepared for yesterday's exam, as I had studied more than any exam I'd ever taken beforehand, given that I had something of a passion for this class. The exam was more than deceptive and poorly tested our knowledge of all content learned the past 6 weeks. Barely any topics were covered, and I feel swindled.

	Document(content="Question: I'm not sure about everyone else, but I felt relatively discouraged after taking the exam tonight. Its content seemed radically different than that content covered in lecture, homeworks, and practice exams given to us to prepare for the exam. As someone who spent significant time studying and preparing I feel that much of my time was wasted since I would likely have done just as poorly had I not prepared or practiced at all with the lecture and practice material provided to us. I am really discouraged by this take away because exams should test students' abilities to understand and apply material, not their ability to make stuff up to try and receive partial credit on questions that they are completely unfamiliar with. I am not usually one to post about frustration, and usually would wait a day before providing negative feedback on an experience, but was in part wondering if others in the class felt the same or similar to myself. Please let me know. I hope that future exams are more reflective of the content that students are comfortable with from both lectures and homework, and that we may feel more adequately prepared for it. I spent 12+ hours studying for this exam, which included reviewing all previous lecture slides, most related colab notebooks from demonstrations, watching supplemental videos on topics, going through practice exams, and reviewing topics with TAs during office hours. I made sure I understood every topic to the depth of the previous exams, and expected a layout consistent with the previous two exams, which I breezed through. The layout of this exam was horrendously different. Around 2 of the questions in the previous exams were fill in the blanks or multiple choice, the next 2 or 3 were simple scripts with some more niche topics i.e. list comprehension, and the last 1 or 2 were graphing/testing process questions. We had no multiple choice or fill in the blanks (i.e. what is the output if...), the short scripts were far more complex in logic, and there were barely any actual graphing/testing/sampling questions. Questions 5 and 6 were entirely out of the scope of anything taught to us, aside from the basic concepts. Having an entire multi-part question based around a niche function was an atrocious decision, and not consistent with topics covered in lecture. If we were expected to know the map() function so well, there should have been a lecture dedicated to that function alone. This exam horribly tested our knowledge of the past 6 weeks' content. Previous exams covered nearly every topic to a decent extent; this exam covered very few topics complexly to an indescribable extent. Answer: Yep, that was ridiculous. Not only was the content way conceptually harder, but the format was also less conducive for a 1 hour exam. There were hardly any multiple choice, unlike the previous exams, and way too many write code/justify answer questions.

	Document(content="Question: I really don't get what this question is doing. I saw that X = -Y means that the realization of Y is the negative of the realization of X. But what does that mean? Does that mean that if X happens, Y doesn't happen, and if X doesn't happen, Y happens? Answer: Informally, a random variable is as a mathematical object that can take different values with different probabilities depending on the outcome of a statistical experiment. There is no notion of a random variable 'happening'. In probability theory, 'events' can happen or not happen. Random variables are merely useful constructs (technically, functions from the sample space to real numbers) to define collections of numerical events to which we can assign probabilities. But all the abstractness aside, let me try to explain this with an example. Let X be a random variable which represents the outcome of a dice throw. Then, X can take the possible values {1,2,3,4,5,6}, and X takes each of these values with probability 1/6. When the dice is thrown (i.e., the statistical experiment is run), we see a particular 'realization' of the random variable, e.g., {X = 4} if the dice came out 4. This means that the event {X = 4} happened. The probability of this event is P(X = 4) = 1/6, and such probabilities make up the PMF of the random variable (because the random variable is discrete in this example). When we define Y = -X, we are constructing a new random variable Y which takes the possible values {-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6}, and in particular, {Y = -j} if and only if {X = j} for j = 1,2,3,4,5,6. This means that when X has realization 4 (i.e., the event {X = 4} occurs), Y has realization -4 (i.e., the event {Y = -4} also occurs). Moreover, the probability P(Y = -4) = P(X = 4) = 1/6.

We can form a graph made out of all the means collected.  However, this question, which only conduct the experiment once, uses the same method to find mean and variance. Shouldn't we conduct the experiment many times in order to form the sampling distribution of the mean and calculate its parameter? How can we form the sampling distribution of the mean with only one experiment/one mean?   Answer: According to the central limit theorem, we know that the overall sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution when the number of samples tends to infinity.

I also don't understand the summation, why does it start at x < 0, and where does it end? Answer: The summation is carried out for all x < 0. So It ends when x >= 0. Realize that for a uniform distribution, all events have the same probability of occurring. So given the set of 4 payoffs, each payoff should have a probability of 1/4 or 0.25. This is q(x) for any x in the context of the problem. The values for p(x) come from the previous parts of the problem. Thus (0.20-0.25) + (0.40-0.25) represents the sum, which is 0.10.

	Document(content="Question: To my understanding, we are trying to make the z-score bigger to make the null hypothesis less probable. You can increase n or decrease variance to make z-bigger. However, if you increase n doesn't that make xbar approach the true mean because of the central limit theorem which would make the null hypothesis more probable? In that case, wouldn't decreasing n mean there is a greater chance xbar is farther away from mu? Answer: This is a great question. For the purposes of the Fall 22 exam, the question implicitly assumes that all other parameters are held constant when a particular parameter is changed. So, xbar is held constant as n is increased. In this case, the z-score would indeed increase with larger n since the standard error reduces. This explains the official solution, and this is what you should assume unless explicitly stated otherwise. On the other hand, your observation is also partly correct. If we do not fix xbar, then as n increases, xbar tends to the population mean mu (due to the law of large numbers). However, this does not allow us to easily conclude that the null hypothesis is more or less probable, because both |xbar - mu| and the standard error are decreasing as n increases, so it is not obvious what happens to the z-score based solely on the formula for z-score. In fact, |xbar - mu| is technically a random variable, so one needs to carefully define what 'decreasing' even means in this scenario. If you go through the exercise of rigorously doing the calculations, you'll see that in some 'average' sense, |xbar - mu| decays at the 'same rate' as the standard error. This is precisely why we can even have a central limit theorem where the Z-variable is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1.

	Document(content="Question: One of the instructors mentioned that there would be an error tolerance of 0.001 on HW 5. What about for the questions that require integer answers? For Problem 2 question 3 I am getting 1228 as my corresponding minimum sample size. This is off by 1 sample from the expected value of 1229. Is my answer correct or did I do something wrong? Answer: 1228 would be an incorrect value for the test case. The wording of the question is asking what would be the minimum. 1228 would not cross the threshold of p = 0.05 This is most likely not due to a rounding error. I think it would be good to look at when you are calculating the standard deviation in your code. You will get 1228 if you use np.std(data1, ddof = 0) or np.std(data1) The following is from the README: To find the standard deviation, type sd = np.std(data, ddof=x) where x is the differential from the number of samples N to determine the degrees of freedom. When we are calculating the standard deviation of a sample, the denominator in equation N-1 so we would set ddof=1 . If we are calculating the standard deviation of the population (i.e. we know the population mean, the numerator in the standard deviation question would be just N, (in which case ddof=0).  We do NOT know the population mean, as we only have survey data from a sample of the population.

The confidence interval equation is (x - t_c*SE, x + t_c *SE) where x=sample mean, SE=standard error, and t_c is found in the earlier equation. t_c can have any value from -infinity to +infinity because it represented the standardized number of standard deviations that the sample is from the population mean. The confidence level c is what should have a value from 0-100% in percentile form and 0-1 in decimal form. For that formula, we are working with probabilities, and hence, should use the decimal form of c. The confidence interval that is returned should be a range with a lower and upper bound.

	Document(content="Note: This note contains useful information on Exam 1, in the form of FAQ. Check here periodically for updates. When/where is the exam? Wednesday, February 22, 6:30-7:35 PM in two different rooms , as explained below: WTHR 200 --- Section 1 (Instructor: Mahsa Ghasemi) and Section 2 (Instructor: Qiang Qiu) BHEE 129 --- Section 3 (Instructor: Murat Kocaoglu) and Section 4 (Instructor: Anuran Makur) We will check the collected exams to make sure you were in the correct room. Is the exam coordinated for all four sections? Yes. What will be on the exam? There will be about 6 questions, covering weeks 1-6 of the course. Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics: Python data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries) Basic Python operations (e.g., loops, arithmetic, manipulating data structures) Functions and higher order functions in Python List comprehensions in Python Histograms Random variables and probability distributions Sampling, the law of large numbers, and the central limit theorem Hypothesis testing What is the format/procedure of the exam? You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet . This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every question. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page. What materials am I allowed to bring? Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are not allowed, but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance. What is the best way to study for the exam? Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homeworks that have been assigned so far. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace. One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material. Will you take off points for syntax errors? If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax. What if I have a DRC accommodation? Please schedule an exam with the DRC Testing Center, and email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same. Note: Students have until 11:55 PM seven days before an exam to submit a request to the DRC Testing Center. Any other logistics to be aware of? There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you. Please try to arrive 10-15 min early to have enough time to find an appropriate seat.

	Document(content="Question: I understand a stencil function slides across a list, and whatever the result of the function is will get placed into a new list. But for this function in Problem 2, it is taking the sum of all the data in the list and dividing it by 3. So where does the sliding/window of operation occurs? Wouldn't it produce the same number no matter how it is slid? def mov_avg(L):	return float(sum(L)) / 3 Answer: You are right about the fact that the function itself produces the same result given that the input remains the same. However, the way you utilize mov_avg to do a sliding window operation is that you change the input parameter (the list L). Consider the snippet of code in Problem2.py from your homework file (lines 37 to 57). If you look at lines 49 and 50, you see that the functions are passed in as the arguments for the stencil function. The sliding window operation will essentially be done in the stencil function. What you want to do in the stencil function (as a reminder, the stencil function has the following parameters - data (the list under consideration), f (the filter function) and width (which is the width of the list that f will take in as its parameter)) is you take 'width' number of elements at a time of a list and call the function on that snippet of the list and append that to the output of your stencil function.

Will I have to setup up a remote SSH connection with ececomp to work on the homework or can I continue to work from my personal machine. I read that the main concern is that the versions of python might not be the same and that can lead to differences in the compilation and success of the code. Can I avoid that problem if I simply know what version of python ececomp or scholar cluster uses and just use that same version on my laptop? Also, I currently program using VS code. Would you recommend I continue with VS code or should I start using Jupyter lab on either the anaconda package or the scholar cluster since for data science its more efficient to use Jupyter Lab or notebook for data processing? Answer: Ok. Here is the ranking: scholar cluster > eceprog > Unix/Linux > Mac > Windows. However, I only worked on my Windows computer when I took this class. You probably will only see differences due to the version or machine in the last few assignments. I will say VS code is even much better than Jupyter. (Jupyter has its own advantages.)

Essentially, in this post anywhere you see ecegrid, replace it with ececomp or eceprog. Just stay consistent. Assignments are accepted through GitHub. If you are a Windows or Mac user, the following is a short tutorial on how to access the ECN servers work on your code, and submit via GitHub Access the Extensions page on the left sidebar and search for the 'Remote - SSH' extension. Go ahead and install that: While you're at it, install Python. Next, navigate on the left sidebar to your remote explorer. Click the plus button, and VS should prompt you with: Type in: ssh YOURPURDUEUSER@ecegrid.ecn.purdue.edu and click enter. ( UPDATE: USE eceprog or ececomp INSTEAD OF ecegrid: YOURPURDUEUSER@eceprog.ecn.purdue.edu) The following prompt might show up... just press enter at the step (if you set it up elsewhere, remember where you set up the config file.). Don't click anything else. Now back to this: Click the settings button and press enter (you want to open the config file). A config file should pop up as follows: Add ' PasswordAuthentication yes' and save the file:  Now going back to the remote explorer: click the open in new window button, the one in the bottom right of the photo below (if you don't see this, click the reload button to the right of the 'REMOTE' and it should update): A prompt will pop up... Click Linux. Yeah you want to continue. Type in your password. Like you would for Microsoft Outlook, so not the xxxx,push password. I'm using ececomp here. You may also use eceprog. At this point VS will take a second to connect to the Linux servers. After it's done loading, open up a new terminal. You'll be able to use all the fancy Linux commands, like ls, cd, etc. At this point you can go ahead and clone your GitHub assignments straight onto the eceprog servers. Navigate to the following section:  You could just clone the repository directly here by linking your GitHub and VSCode accounts. Follow the prompts, give VS/Github permission where they request it, etc. If you cloned already, then open the folder that you cloned by clicking 'open folder' and just navigate to whatever it's called. It's possible you have to type in your password again. Just follow whatever the prompts ask you to do. You also might have to trust the authors of the file. Click yes in this case. At this point my screen looks like this (you'll see different files. This repo is not a 20875 repo):  All of the files are now one click away and you can edit directly in VSCode. When you save, it automatically saves to the eceprog servers. Another tip - you know you're connected to the server because of the bottom left that says SSH: eceprog.ecn.purdue.edu . Remember that you still have to commit and push for GitHub to receive your changes. You're able to do all that in the VSCode terminal. To run/test your files, there's a little play button to the top right of the window. Click this and it will run the python file that is currently open.

	Document(content="Question: I was looking through the syllabus and noticed a Scholar cluster mentioned. I've never heard of this, and was wondering if I could receive some clarification on this topic? Are we supposed to download a specific IDE from this cluster? Answer: The Scholar cluster (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/scholar) is a computer cluster that you will have access to as a part of this class. You can make use of it (more instructions on the website!) to write and test your homework/project code. While you can (and it is good that you do) set up Python for your personal computer, you can also use Scholar to run your programs (and you don't have to download any particular IDE, or anything really, to make use of Scholar). That aside, to ensure consistency in grading, we ask that your code must run on the versions of Python in the Scholar cluster.

	Document(content="Question: Hello, First of all, I hope you had a nice winter break. I am very excited to start this semester and take this course. It sounds very interesting and important for my future studies. My name is Ata Ulas Guler. I'm a sophomore from Turkey, studying computer engineering. I went back home for this Christmas break, so I am currently in Turkey. My flight will arrive on Tuesday, so unfortunately I will be missing my classes on Monday and Tuesday. These include ECE 20875 26452-004. I wanted to post a question here so that you are aware of my absence. I have read the syllabus and will be checking any announcement you have made or will be making in the next couple of days. Is there anything you want me to do for this absence? I would appreciate your answers, and I wish everyone a great semester :) Thank you for your time and understanding, Ata Ulas Guler Answer: Since there is a small fraction of your grade that depends on attendance, your absence on Tuesday will be recorded. But one absence alone is unlikely to affect your overall grade. You can catch up on the content of the first lecture by reading the Brightspace materials. If you have further questions about this, please contact the TAs.

	Document(content="Note: Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started: Ask questions! The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are). Edit questions and answers wiki-style. Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors’ answer for instructors). Add a followup to comment or ask further questions. To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion . Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above. Go anonymous. Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously. Tag your posts. It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag. Format code and equations. Adding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. Mathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation. View and download class details and resources. Click the Course Page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!Contact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at team@piazza.com .
