	Document(content="Note: This note contains useful information on Exam 3, in the form of FAQ. Check here periodically for updates. When/where is the exam? Monday, April 29th , 3:30-4:35 PM in STEW 183 (One location for all sections). Sample exams: Previous semester exams and their corresponding solutions can be found in the 'Exam 3' module within the content tab on Brightspace. Is the exam coordinated for all sections? Yes. What will be on the exam? There will be about 6 questions, covering weeks 12-16 of the course. Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics: kMeans clustering Gaussian mixture models Inheritance kNN Naïve Bayes Logistic regression Neural networks What is the format/procedure of the exam? You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet . This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every question. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page. What materials am I allowed to bring? Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are not allowed , but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance. What is the best way to study for the exam? Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homeworks that have been assigned so far. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace. One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material. Will you take off points for syntax errors? If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax. What if I have a DRC accommodation? Please schedule an exam with the DRC Testing Center, and email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same. Note: Students have until 11:55 PM seven days before an exam to submit a request to the DRC Testing Center. Any other logistics to be aware of? There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you. Please try to arrive 10-15 min early to have enough time to find an appropriate seat.

	Document(content="Note: Hello Everyone, The final project has been released and is due on April 28th, 11:59 pm ET. This project is designed to put your knowledge of data analysis to use, where you will be given a dataset and asked to draw conclusions from it. You will need to understand what the data is showing you, design the analyses you need, justify those choices, draw conclusions from running the analyses, and explain why they do (or do not) make sense. Mini Project: https://classroom.github.com/a/4jkJIuOr There are three possible paths to choose from, and you may work with one partner (from the same section) if you wish. Working with a partner is optional and will not impact how the project is graded. If you decide to work with a partner, please remember that only one of the two members, i.e., the team-lead, needs to submit the completed code (to GitHub) and PDF report (to Gradescope). The team lead should use Gradescope's group submission feature to upload the PDF report. ( https://youtu.be/rue7p_kATLA?si=lMuVsI-jU366VmCK ).

When you do this for $$\beta_1$$, you would use 50 for $$x_{1,1}$$ So for $$\beta_1$$the equation is: $$\beta_1^{\{t+1\}} =0.2 + \alpha (y_1 - f_{\beta}(x_1) * x_{1,1} $$ $$=\beta_1^{\{t+1\}} =0.2 + \alpha (1- 0.5) * 50 $$ ", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Spring 2022, Exam 3', 'timestamp': '2024-04-25T21:56:32Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['exam', 'student'], 'likes': 1, 'views': 144}),

Answer: KNN comes to mind - week 14 covered classification pretty well You are trying to classify the biker data and you have 7 classes - 7 days of the week. (Could work) I think it's not wise to make a linear model for this task since you are trying to predict the day of the week - that's only 7 possible outcomes you can accept.

	Document(content="Question: I've read through the example that is provided in the README and the documentation for 'kernel_pca', but I'm still really struggling to implement anything that has a meaningful impact on the noise. From what I can gather, the whole point of using 'kernel_pca' is to create a lower dimensional model than the actual data, i.e. a model with only the components most relevant to the number, so that by transforming the model back into the normal amount of components, the image will be denoised. Is this thinking correct? From there, what is the best way to tune the 'kernel_pca' model into something useable? I've tried playing around with the n_components, gamma, and alpha parameters, but since I have no idea what each of these things control, I have no way of knowing how to optimize them. Basically, a summary of the process we're trying to preform and a starting point on finding the right parameters would both be extremely helpful. Answer: I believe `alpha` and `gamma` should be tuned using cross validation and then choosing the one that maximizes accuracy for one or more of the models. I was able to recover around 90% of the accuracy from before the noise was added, which I'm fine with. I think `n_component` should be set to $$64$$ so that there is a component for each individual pixel maybe? You can experiment with this. I don't think we want to reduce dimensionality in this case. The `kernel_pca` denoising process will have little visual effect, though. Plotting images from before and after the denoising shows almost no effect. Even with this, all three models are able to recover good accuracy after this process.

	Document(content="Question: I have some issues with the way this homework provides the expected outputs to me. I have completed the entire code for part 1, hw8_1.py, and I am somewhat confident that it works, as it identifies the text to be in german which it is. However, when I try to confirm my steps 2 and 3 are working correctly, I get a little confused. I will strat with the easier part: in step 3, the output of the program should be a path to the language file that corresponds to the language in which the mystery is written? so if the file is in german, the output should not be something like 'its in german' but rather ngrams\german.txt ? For step 2 of the first problem, the README specifies that if I uncomment the test case, I should expect an output: [' a a', ' a b', ' a c', ' a d', ' a e', ' a f', ' a g', ' a h', ' a i', ' a l', ' a m', ' a n', ' a o', ' a p', ' a q', ' a r', ' a s', ' a t', ' a u', ' a v', ' a w', ' aba', ' abb', ' abe', ' acc', ' ace', ' ach', ' act', ' acu', ' ad ', ' ada', ' ade', ' adh', ' adm', ' adv', ' aff', ' afi', ' aga', ' age', ' agi', ' agr', ' aha', ' ahi', ' ai ', ' aid', ' aim', ' ain', ' aip', ' ait', ' aji'] but my output is nowhere near this.

Is this not an expected output but rather some form of template that our output should follow? The wording/phrasing in README does not make this very clear. I appreciate any comments on this. Answer: 1. The output file should be the filepath, so the format should be just ngrams\languagefile.txt 2. Do you use the function get_formatted_text(filename)? If not, please use that in your get_ngrams function. This function, if you notice, makes everything lowercase and adds whitespace to the ngrams if needed.

Select 'graded-update.' 5. Locate the 'grading_output.txt' file within your repository. This file is a treasure trove of information, providing a breakdown of your test case performance and their corresponding point allocations. Please be aware that our standard grading process involves the evaluation of homework assignments through the use of various test cases. Your code will be assessed against a range of these test cases documented in the 'grading_output.txt' file. Each test case is assigned points, with the difficulty level determining the point value. In the event that you believe there may be an error in your grade, a discrepancy between the scores on GitHub and BrightSpace, or if you have been granted an extension that hasn't been considered, we encourage you to submit a regrade request to us at ece20875.purdue.university@gmail.com . You have one week and some days from the date of grade posting on BrightSpace to submit such requests (a deadline of March 30 th ). When reaching out for a regrade, please ensure to provide the following information: A link to your GitHub repository (critical for homework assignments). 2. Section Number . 3.

	Document(content="Question: How are we supposed to know which degree function fits the data the best, they're very similar? I saw a note on normalizing the data, is my output wrong? Answer: This is something you'll need to determine yourself. In general, the more degrees used the better it will fit the data. But there does become a point where overfitting occurs, ie where the model struggles to accurately fit similar but not identical data sets. So ideally, we want to use the smallest number of degrees that best fits the data. Some questions that might help you decide: How do the coefficients change as degree increases, especially considering the coefficients of the higher order terms? If a coefficient is very close to 0, is this term contributing much to the model accuracy, or can it be removed without much loss of accuracy? Also, while we cannot confirm whether your plot here is correct or not, if you are matching the test cases provided for the degree 2 and 4 models up to 3 decimal places, then that is strong evidence that your other models are also correct.

	Document(content="Question: When I uncomment the values of the given data, lmbda = [1, 500, 1000, 2500], I get the correct final answer, and the MSE vs Lambda graph looks reasonable... when working on the graph for the normal data that is not given for an example, I am getting a graph that does not look like I think it should. Is this graph correct? if not, is there anything that I can do to make it look correct. it almost seems upside down? thank you! Answer: First, I think it's important to note that the same MSE vs lambda relationship is being plotted in each version: using the example code 'lmbda = [1, 500, 1000, 2500]' just confines the plotted lambda values to these four values, whereas using 'get_lambda_range' changes this range to 51 lambda values between 0.1 and 1000. You can check this yourself too. Try using 'lmbda = np.arange(start=1,stop=2500,num)' for your lambda values, choosing an appropriate value for num, the number of points created (50-100 should be enough to see the trend). You should get a much smoother version of the plot you see using lmbda = [1, 500, 1000, 2500]. (FYI if you do try this, make sure not to change your writeup answer to problem 2.1 and 2.2 since we are grading these questions using the range of lambda values in 'get_lambda_range'). As for what is happening when lambda is close to 0, remember that we use regularization in the first place to prevent model overfitting. Which for stock market data, which contains both fine-scale day-to-day fluctuations as well as larger more long-term price trends, overfitting is a serious consideration. So while a certain choice of lambda may minimize the MSE for the training data, that may prevent the model from generalizing to new data. Slide 37 of the Regression slides may also be helpful in understanding why your lambda values close to 0 may be appearing as they are.

	Document(content="Question: After I normalize my X_Goog data and use my model to predict the y-values, all of the data points are very small. I assume this was because my data was normalized but I don't think that should matter.

Am I supposed to be normalizing the regular y data as well, or is my model just wrong to be giving me values around zero? Also, I think my model should be right because I got the correct value when testing with the given lambda values Answer: The predicted y values should match fairly close to the actual data, and you should only be regularizing your input data.

Would I interpret this as degree 3 being the right fit? The more degrees I add the more accurate it becomes, but isn't that due to it just using more points rather than fitting the data better? Answer: This is something you have to answer yourself, but a question that might help you along is how does the equation change as the degree increases above 3? What is the weight and impact that higher degrees have on the graph? Also, the higher degrees you have, generally the better it will fit a specific dataset. But, it is important on how well it will represent a similar but not identical datasets (overfitting).

We've determined that this was due to an error with one of our grading scripts that was not properly linking between the score on Github and the real-life identity of each student. To be clear, the score on the Github report is correct, the issue was with a supporting script as part of the process to transfer that grade to Brightspace. This has now been fixed for HW 3, and the updated grades have been released on Brightspace. This should ensure that the grades on Brightspace now match the score on Github. Please note that not everyone will see an updated grade. We do apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. As a result, we will be extending the window for regrade requests until next Friday, March 8 . We will still look into any requests received up until now that may have been fixed by this grade update, but if any issues remain please reach out via the regrade process (detailed in the syllabus and in the HW 3 grade release post).

	Document(content="Note: Good evening everyone, The grades for Homework 3 are now available across all sections. To access your feedback, kindly follow these steps: Navigate to your Homework 3 repository on GitHub. 2. Click on the 'main' dropdown menu. 3. Opt for 'Tags' from the menu. 4. Select 'graded-update.' 5. Locate the 'grading_output.txt' file within your repository. This file is a treasure trove of information, providing a breakdown of your test case performance and their corresponding point allocations. Please be aware that our standard grading process involves the evaluation of homework assignments through the use of various test cases. Your code will be assessed against a range of these test cases documented in the 'grading_output.txt' file. Each test case is assigned points, with the difficulty level determining the point value. In the event that you believe there may be an error in your grade, a discrepancy between the scores on GitHub and BrightSpace, or if you have been granted an extension that hasn't been considered, we encourage you to submit a regrade request to us at ece20875.purdue.university@gmail.com . You have one week from the date of grade posting on BrightSpace to submit such requests (a deadline of March 5 th ). When reaching out for a regrade, please ensure to provide the following information: A link to your GitHub repository (critical for homework assignments). 2. Section Number . 3. Grading item (e.g., Homework 3). 4. Purdue email address ( if the email is not sent from a Purdue account). 5. A detailed explanation or justification for the regrade request, with specific reference to the README.

	Document(content="Question: I am having trouble understanding sweep_n. From what I understand, sweep_n is essentially used to call compute_j a specified number of times and append this value to a list. To do this, plt.hist must be called to retrieve the number of counts, n. plt.hist should take in the parameters (x, bins, range) which translate to (data, max_bins-min_bins, max_val-min_val). j_vals should then be called within a loop of the range of bins, and pass the parameters data and counts from the plt.hist calculation. Here is my code, thank you for any help! j_vals = []bin_width = max_bins - min_binsbin_range = max_val - min_valcounts = plt.hist(data, bins=bin_width, range=bin_range)i = min_binsfor i in max_bins: j_add = compute_j(data, counts) j_vals.append(j_add) i = i+1return j_vals Answer: Double check how your calculating the bin width. The inputs 'min_bins' and 'max_bins' represent a range of bins to calculate J values for. So for each of the possible number of bins between 'min_bins' and 'max_bins,' you need to calculate the J value (making sure to include the min and max values and with a step size of 1). For each of these possible bin configurations, the bin width (necessary to find the J value) will be changing, hence the need to sweep over all the bin configurations. Also to reiterate, 'compute_J' takes as input a numpy array of histogram counts, and a bin width. Additionally, the 'range' input of 'plt.hist' is a tuple.

	Document(content="Question: I am having trouble understanding what exactly this function is supposed to do, can someone please help explain more in depth than the explanations in the readme and in the code? Answer: I'm going to go a bit into the theory about calculating J values and why we do that before talking about the implementation we want, since I think that might be helpful to understanding the assignment structure for problem 1. Given some set of samples (eg, the raw data) that belong to an unknown distribution, plotting these samples using a histogram allows us to estimate what the actual distribution looks like. However, the accuracy of our histogram estimate is going to be dependent on the number of bins we use. You can imagine that a histogram with only a single bin (very large bin width) isn't very useful, and likewise a histogram with 1000 bins (very small bin width) also isn't going to be useful if you only have 100 samples. So, to get a good estimate of the underlying distribution, we need to choose a proper bin width. This is where the J value comes into play. The full details are on slides 18-20 of the 'histogram.pdf' from Week 2 up on Brightspace, but suffice it to say that if we calculate J using several different bin widths (remember, J is a function with input being the bin width), then the input bin width that gives the smallest J value will be the optimal bin width; that is, the bin width with the smallest J value will make our histogram model the best estimate of the underlying distribution. In Problem 1, we ask you in the function 'compute_j' to calculate the J value, given a numpy array of samples (param 'histo') and a bin width (param 'bin_width'). With this in mind, in 'sweep_n' we want you to calculate the J value for a range of possible bin widths. This will allows us in 'find_min' to find the optimal bin width (specifically, the 3 best bin widths) that would allow us in theory to construct the best histogram to model the data in 'input.txt'. Please note that you aren't given the bin widths to check directly. Instead, you're given a range of total bins for the histogram, ranging from param 'min_bins' to param 'max_bins' (inclusive!). Using a step size of 1, you'll need to calculate the bin width for the given number of bins, call 'compute_j' to find the corresponding J value, and output the list of all the J values. Hopefully this helps clear things up for you!

	Document(content="Note: Hi everyone! Hope your coding is going well! We just want to clarify a few issues that have come up so far in Homework 3: Problem 1 : When checking the expected result of the ' find_min ' function, the values of the last few decimal places may differ slightly. Please note that as the Readme states, we will only be checking out to 4 decimal places ; so as long as the first 4 decimal places match you will receive full credit. Additionally with ' find_min ', please make sure to return a dictionary object and ignore the docstring statement to return as a tuple. Input Types There are some confusing statements regarding the input type of some variables in problem 1. To clarify: - norm_histogram : param 'histo' is a numpy array - compute_j : param 'histo' should be a numpy array - sweep_n : param 'data' should be a numpy array Problem 2: There are a few typos in the description of the 'find_dist ' function that may be a bit confusing. - param 'dists' is a list of strings (list[str]) and not floats. - param 'sum_err' is a list of floats (list[float]) and not strings. There are also conflicting instructions on how to format the output of ' find_dist ', with the Readme stating to use a tuple, while the function description states not to use a tuple. While either data structure will provide the correct result (that is, 'return (out_1, out_2)' and 'return out_1, out_2' will both provide the desired output result), for the purposes of clarity, we ask that you follow the Readme instructions to use a tuple , and disregard the conflicting instructions in the function description.

	Document(content="Question: I'm confused on how to check my code matches the test cases in PyCharm. I've tried looking it up but I can't figure it out. Answer: On GitHub, you are provided with homework2.py file that contains your two functions for the two tasks but you are also provided with additional Python files that contain the test cases. For instance, testhisto1.py is a Python file that will make a function call to the histogram function, problem 1, gives the function some specific input in the form of a data list, and prints out the output produced by your function which should hopefully be a list as well. All you have to do to test your code is run the testhisto1.py file or any other file depending on what problem you want to test out. In problem 1 test cases, it appears that there are no comments on what the expected output should be, however, you can either calculate the outputs on some scratch paper and compare them to what your function produces, or you can modify the test cases to use specific examples and answers provided in the readme file in the repository for HW2. If its the IDE that's causing you trouble, just run the Python files from your terminal. Use 'cd' to navigate to the repo that contains your python files and they use something like 'python testhisto1.py' to run the test case. cd <repository that contains your homework file on you desktop computer>python testhistor1.py -> if you wrote your function without any syntax errors, the least you should see in the terminal is some output or message.

You can use it in order to do your homeworks on the remote server. However, I would advise you to set up an ssh key and ssh into the remote server without using ThinLinc. If you do not want to do this, I would advise you to at least use ThinLinc because doing the homeworks on a local computer may cause differences between your outputs and the autograder's since the autograder is run on ecn.

Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are). Edit questions and answers wiki-style. Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors’ answer for instructors). Add a followup to comment or ask further questions. To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion . Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above. Go anonymous. Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously. Tag your posts. It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag. Format code and equations. Adding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. Mathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation. View and download class details and resources.
