	Document(content="Note: Hi class! For those who are working with a partner on a Mini Project, it is your free will to decide how to collaborate. For instance, team members can collaborate offline, by sharing and updating the python scripts. Or, members can decide to use a shared GitHub repository to collaborate. However , given the settings of the GitHub assignment and the students' GitHub accounts administered by GitHub Classroom, it is not possible to add collaborators to the repository that you clone for the mini project from the Piazza link. Therefore, in order to collaborate within GitHub, it is suggested that 1) only one of the team members create a GitHub repository by accepting a link posted on the Piazza. 2) Team members create a separate 'local' GitHub repository, that is not tied to the GitHub Classroom, and collaborate using that. 3) After finishing the project, push all required files to the repository that we grade (the one cloned from the Piazza link). In this case, only one of the team members is responsible for pushing. Just make sure to clearly state the name of the collaborator on the report. In the same manner, only one of the team members can submit the report to the Gradescope.

	Document(content="Note: This note contains useful information on Exam 3, in the form of FAQ. Check here periodically for updates. When/where is the exam? Tuesday, December 13, 10:30-11:35 AM in two different rooms , as explained below: WTHR 200 --- Section 1 (Instructor: Philip Paré) and Section 2 (Instructor: Qiang Qiu) UC 114 --- Section 4 (Instructor: Mahsa Ghasemi) and Section 5 (Instructor: Rajeev Sahay) We will check the collected exams to make sure you were in the correct room. For all four sections? Yes. What will be on the exam? There will be 6-8 questions, covering weeks 12-16 of the course. Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics: Objects and classes Inheritance kMeans clustering kNN Gaussian mixture models Naive bayes Logistic regression Neural networks What is the format/procedure of the exam? You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet . This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every question. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page. What materials am I allowed to bring? Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are not allowed, but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance. What is the best way to study for the exam? Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homeworks that have been assigned so far. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace. One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material. Will you take off for syntax errors? If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax. What if I have a DRC accommodation? Please schedule an exam with the DRC Testing Center, and email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same. Note: Students needing to take their final exam with DRC Testing must submit their final exam request by 11:55 PM (EST) on November 18th . Any other logistics to be aware of? There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you. Please try to arrive 10-15 min early to have enough time to find an appropriate seat. Also, as in lecture, you must follow Purdue’s COVID-19 protocols.

	Document(content="Note: For Part 8 of Problem 2, there were questions about how to process the 'GOOG.csv', and how to plot the graph. Here are some clarifications. For Part 8, same preprocessing steps used for 'APPL.csv' should be applied to 'GOOG.csv'. Thus, the code provided in 'regularize-cv.py', containing 7 steps for processing the 'APPL.csv' file, can be used again for the 'GOOG.csv' file. When fitting the 'GOOG.csv' file, target variable and feature vectors should be the following: 1) Target variable 'y' is generated by shifting the values in Close column by 1. 2) Attribute vectors correspond to all the remaining columns in 'GOOG.csv', except for the Close column and the Date column. (The procedure is the same as when the 'APPL.csv' file was processed.) When drawing a plot in Part 8, just plot target variable, y , and predicted value, y_hat . There is no need to explicitly designate the labels for x and y axes. For example, it is recommended to use the below code block to generate the plot. ''' plt.figure() plt.plot(y_hat, label='prediction') plt.plot(y, label='actual') plt.legend(fontsize=10, loc='upper left') plt.title('Google Test') plt.show() ''' The title of the plot can be anything. It does not necessarily have to be 'Google Test' as given in the code block above. However, the label of true target_variable and the predicted target_variable should be clearly named so that we can recognize which plot corresponds to which value.

For example, if there are three instances of 4 in data that comply with bin i, just increment hist[i] by 1, not 3.' The above condition might raise confusion in understanding the concept of histogram. The definition of histogram is to show how frequently a value falls into a particular bin. Following the definition of histogram, it is originally correct to increment the histogram bin by counting all number of values that comply with a particular bin, regardless of whether they are duplicated or not. In that sense, the Condition 8 of Problem 1 goes against the definition of histogram. Therefore, the Condition 8 of Problem 1 should rather only be interpreted as a preprocessing step for filtering the data points, prior to building a histogram.

Take the node at the top with weights [1, -2]. If the input is x = $$ (x_1, x_2) $$ = (1,1), the sum is $$ 1 * x_1 - 2 * x_2 $$ = -1. Considering the step function as the activation function, the output of that node is 0. Similarly, for the node at the bottom, the sum will be +1, meaning that the output of that node is 1 (since 1 > 0). For the neuron at the end, the sum is 3 * 0 - 3 * 1 = -3, which means that the output of this node is going to be 0 (since the step function is 0 whenever its input is <= 0.

	Document(content="Question: Can somebody explain why odds increase when feature x2 decreases? I thought P(y=1 | x) / P(y=0 | x) is just exp(B0 + B1x1 + ... BmXm) so wouldn't either feature's increase cause an increase in odds? Thanks in advance! Answer: It depends on the coefficient of each feature. The odds are given by: $$\frac{P(y = 1 | x)}{P(y = 0 | x)} = exp({\beta}_0+{\beta}_1x_1+{\beta}_2x_2 + ... + {\beta}_mx_m)$$ Let's say you increase some feature $$ x_j $$ by 1 unit. The ratio of the odds gives you an idea of if the odds have increased or decreased if you increase that feature. The ratio of the odds will be given by: $$\frac{odds(x_j + 1)}{odds(x_j)} = exp(b_j)$$ If the coefficient of the feature j, $$ b_j $$, is negative, the ratio of the odds is lesser than 1 (which means that the odds have decreased). So, when the coefficient of a feature is negative, then an increase in the feature leads to the decrease in odds. Similarly, when $$ b_j $$ is positive, the ratio of odds is positive, meaning that the odds have increased when the feature has been increased. Hope this helps!

Then for each new coefficient, it's: B(0, t+1) = B(0) + fb(x) * a => B(0, t+1) = 1 + 0.5a B(1, t+1) = B(1) + fb(x) * x1 * a => B(1, t + 1) = 1 + 0.5 * 0 * a = 1 B(2, t + 1) = B(2) + fb(x) *x2 * a => B(2, t+1) = -2 +0.5 *0.5 * a = -2 +0.25a ", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Exam 3 Fall 2021 6D (again)', 'timestamp': '2022-12-11T20:35:55Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['exam', 'student'], 'likes': 4, 'views': 130}),

The projects instructions do not limit you from referencing multiple files, and if organizing your code with multiple files makes it easier for you to complete the assignment, that is ok and you can submit it like that.

(3) -1 / Explanation appears correct but is not clear or should be elaborated upon (4) -1 / Elaborate on the importance of a lower degree with regards to preventing overfitting. Otherwise correct. (5) -5 / Incorrect. A 3rd degree model should be used because higher degrees have negligible x^4 and x^5 coefficients and would overfit.

That said, models created with regularization should have smaller constant coefficients in front of each X's compared to those that are created without regularization.

Answer: A confidence interval [l, u] means that you are x percent confident that the population parameter is captured by the interval. If you want to be more confident that your population parameter is captured, your interval intuitively needs to be larger. And vice versa. Don’t really understand what your second question means. “85% of the mean”?

Answer: For part 8, same preprocessing steps used for 'APPL.csv' should be applied to 'GOOG.csv'. Thus, the code provided in 'regularize-cv.py', containing 7 steps for processing the 'APPL.csv' file, can be used again for the 'GOOG.csv' file.

(The procedure is the same as when the 'APPL.csv' file was processed.) When drawing a plot in Part 8, just plot target variable, y , and predicted value, y_hat . There is no need to explicitly designate the labels for x and y axes. For example, it is recommended to use the below code block to generate the plot.

Answer: It would probably be easier to fill in feature_matrix and least_squares first. feature_matrix takes in data, x, and a degree, d, and returns a feature matrix (see slides for how to construct the feature matrix). least_squares just implements the least squares equation (solution to beta) from the slides. For this part, you just have to implement the solution for beta given in the slides. This will return a list (or numpy array) of the coefficients of the model. In the main function, loop through each element in degrees. For each degree, you should call feature_matrix to construct your feature matrix. Then, call least_squares using the returned feature matrix from the previous step as input. The list that is returned by least_squares should be appended to paramFits. So, paramFits will be a list of lists OR could also be a list of 1D numpy arrays.

If your p-value is less than these alpha values, then your results are statistically significant at that level. You don't divide alpha by 2.

What is the purpose of this? Do we need this when we submit, and does it need to also work on my laptop? Answer: Are you on Windows? The shebang line (`#!...`) tells the operating system where to look for the Python interpreter, but on windows you won't have this file. That's fine, keep the shebang line (we need it for grading) and invoke your code with `python ` (if I guessed wrong and you're not on windows, use `python3` instead of `python`).

The username is fine but when I try to type in the password, nothing shows up in the terminal, so I can't enter my password. I'm not sure if this relates to the problem, but it asks for my login info directly in the terminal, not in a popup window like in the video. I'm using a Jupyter notebook terminal on windows. Answer: Nothing showing up when you type your password is a security feature, your password is being typed but it’s just hiding the length of it. However, GitHub has changed it’s authentication recently. If your password still doesn’t work you may need to create a personal access token to use in place of your password. See https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token You may also want to consider cloning using HTTPS instead of ssh (or vice versa).

	Document(content="Note: Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started: Ask questions! The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are). Edit questions and answers wiki-style. Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors’ answer for instructors). Add a followup to comment or ask further questions. To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion . Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above. Go anonymous. Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously. Tag your posts. It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag. Format code and equations. Adding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. Mathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation. View and download class details and resources. Click the Course Page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!Contact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at team@piazza.com .
