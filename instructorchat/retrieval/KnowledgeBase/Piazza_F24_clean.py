	Document(content="Note: This note contains useful information on Exam 3, in the form of FAQ. Check here periodically for updates.When/where is the exam?13th December (Friday), 7:00-8:05 PM in two different rooms, as explained below: BHEE 129 --- Section 1 (Instructor: Prof. Murat Kocaoglu)WTHR 200 --- Section 2 & 4 (Instructors: Prof. Qiang Qiu and Prof. Anuran Makur)Sample exams: Previous semester exams and their corresponding solutions can be found in the \'Exam 3\' module within the content tab on Brightspace.Is the exam coordinated for all sections?Yes.What will be on the exam?There will be about 6 questions, covering weeks 11-16 of the course. Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics:kMeans clusteringGaussian mixture modelsInheritancekNNNaïve BayesLogistic regressionNeural networksWhat is the format/procedure of the exam?You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet. This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every question. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page.What materials am I allowed to bring?Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are not allowed, but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance.What is the best way to study for the exam?Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homeworks that have been assigned so far. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace.One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material.Will you take off points for syntax errors?If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax.What if I have a DRC accommodation?Please schedule an exam with the DRC Testing Center, and email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same.Note: Students have until 11:55 PM seven days before an exam to submit a request to the DRC Testing Center.Any other logistics to be aware of?There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you. Please try to arrive 10-15 min early to have enough time to find an appropriate seat. ", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Exam 3: FAQ', 'timestamp': '2024-11-30T06:38:07Z', 'user': 'kskmx82xa2s4ad', 'tags': ['exam', 'instructor-note', 'pin'], 'likes': 1, 'views': 257}),

If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax.What if I have a DRC accommodation?Please schedule an exam with the DRC Testing Center, and email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same.Note: Students have until 11:55 PM seven days before an exam to submit a request to the DRC Testing Center.Any other logistics to be aware of?There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you. Please try to arrive 10-15 min early to have enough time to find an appropriate seat.", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Exam 1: FAQ', 'timestamp': '2024-09-19T03:48:42Z', 'user': 'kskmx82xa2s4ad', 'tags': ['exam', 'instructor-note', 'pin'], 'likes': 3, 'views': 297}),

	Document(content="Question: I am working on the mini project for path 1, and have descended into a rabbit hole of confusion for all 3 questions.The first question which can be paraphrased \'is it possible to naturally cluster the students\' I have been led to that the answer is just straight up no. Using KMeans for a range of n_clusters= 1 to 25 and printing out the number of students in each cluster for each clusters results in there always being clusters with thousands of students and some with only 1-5. Below is shown the output for n_clusters=11 (I print out all 0-24 in my actual program).-------Evaluating kmeans in cluster 11---------Number of students in cluster 0 of 10 is 10270Number of students in cluster 1 of 10 is 1Number of students in cluster 2 of 10 is 2621Number of students in cluster 3 of 10 is 7Number of students in cluster 4 of 10 is 7Number of students in cluster 5 of 10 is 1Number of students in cluster 6 of 10 is 4Number of students in cluster 7 of 10 is 332Number of students in cluster 8 of 10 is 394Number of students in cluster 9 of 10 is 6Number of students in cluster 10 of 10 is 29I researched into other methods and found the elbow method and also PCA plotting, and the elbow method indicates a strong k-value in the range of like 8-12, which seems really high to me, and this leads to when I make a PCA plot, A lot of the clusters overlap heavily on it, and there really doesn\'t seem to be a good k-value for the clusters. I\'ve tried lower values but it just ends up with nearly all (thousands) of the students in one cluster and then like 1-50 in the other(s). I\'ve reviewed my code pretty thoroughly and am pretty sure I\'ve done everything right. I am standardizing my data (using StandardScaler), then using KMeans to be applied to my filtered (watched >= 5 videos) students using fit_predict on the standardized data for each iteration.For question 2 (paraphrased \'can we predict mean value of a students score across all videos\'), I initially thought to use a logistic regression, before realizing logistic regressions only apply to binary values, so I cannot use it since a mean score is on a range [0, 1], so this leaves a linear regression and ridge regression. In the slides it mentions ridge regression is better for data with many features, and considering that I am using 7-10 features (I\'ve been playing with that a lot too), I figured ridge regression would be good. However, after running cross-validation in order to get the best lambda/regularization parameter (or alpha in Python), and using it on ridge regression my ridge regression ends up with an r^2 value of 0.035, which is absolutely atrocious. This led me to try linear regression, but that had similar results. So do I just show all my data and say that there is no correlation?Finally, question 3 (paraphrased \'for each video can we predict what a student will score on that video\'), I am using a logistic regression since it is binary, either they score 0 or 1. I repeat for every video_id: split the data into the feature matrix and output / scores / target for that video and then train test split and then fit the logistic regression and check the accuracy score. This one actually has pretty decent results, which I am checking by outputting the accuracy score for all 93 videos. Most videos fall in the range of 60-80% accuracy score, with some outliers. This one not as confused about but just making sure that this logic is what the question wants to see.Do these results sound about right? I can share my code if necessary, or screenshots of the graphs. Answer: I prefer not telling you the results are right or wrong. First, the questions are open questions. Second, to ensure the fairness among the class, I prefer not revealing the preference on your results. However, I could ask some questions as a peer in your class. I think there is one question to be answered. Since your model\'s performance is not high, does that mean the features have no correlation or your model is not good enough to capture them? For example, if I increase the complexity of the model, will it increase the performance? Note that your report is expected to have conclusions with your reasons and evidence to support. ", meta={'folders': ['project'], 'title': 'Mini Project Path 1 Logic / Results', 'timestamp': '2024-12-06T03:53:49Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['project', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 9}),

Answer: In the project, you could use any libraries you like to draw your conclusions. But please note that you need to explain your reasons clearly (for example, it is not enough to just say that I use the numpy polynomial to do the analysis. You need to use mathematical language to explain what polynomial models you use. )As explained in the handout, only one of your team members need to submit the code and the writeup. So, as long as you or your teammate submit the code and the write up, you will be fine. Therefore, for code sharing, you can create your own github repo for code sharing/editing. Or you can use any other file transfers to sync. For the writeup, you need to clearly indicate what questions you are trying to answer, what are your conclusions, what are your evidence and reasons, etc. There is not a particular format assigned.

	Document(content="Question: For the third patter, I\'m somewhat confused as to how Regex handles overlapping. So my assumption is that [a-z]+ would match with all of \'darthvader\' since its greedy. Then, it won\'t match anything for [0-9]*, which is fine. But for [a-zA-Z\-], is it still able to match with \'darthvader\'? If so, why - shouldn\'t it start trying to match with \'@\' since [a-z]+ has already used \'darthvader\'? Is there some backtracking element which allows it to match? Thanks! Answer: Very subtle question! We did not go into details of the regex engine and its translation to finite-state automata, which would explain the underlying implementation. A regex quantifier like + is inherently greedy as you point out, but also *docile*. This means that the engine will match as much as possible, but if this results in the rest of the regex being unable to match the string, the engine will indeed backtrack (usually one character at a time) to have the full regex match some part of the string.", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Question about Regex overlapping', 'timestamp': '2024-11-17T20:37:46Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['exam', 'student'], 'likes': 1, 'views': 122}),

But the table shows areas over the interval (-infinity,z). Since the area over the interval (-z,z) is 0.96, the area over the two tails (i.e., (z, infinity) and (-infinity,-z)) are 0.02 each by symmetry of the Gaussian. So, if we found the z-value such that the area over (-infinity,z) is 0.96 + 0.02 = 0.98, then the area over the interval (-z,z) would be 0.96 as desired. This is why we choose z = 2.05 instead of z = 1.75.", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Fall 2022 Confidence Interval', 'timestamp': '2024-11-15T02:47:38Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['exam', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 136}),

Is this a correct answer because \'valid match\' means it matches something in the string, even if it isn\'t the whole string, or is this an error in the answer key? Answer: The question writer in this case was likely asking whether the \'match()\' method would return something other than None.

	Document(content="Question: I keep having trouble while building my doc_word matrix. I have the matrix being filled out by a series of for-loops, and then the counter for each ngram iterating through each document in order to find how many occurrences of the ngram there is. This method proves to take too long to load, and I have been unable to see the results of the calculation yet. Is there a better method that you recommend going about this portion? Since I must be taking an incorrect approach if it is taking this long to run. Answer: The logic of building the word doc is:1. Prepare Text Documents: Each document is read, cleaned, and then split into smaller word segments (called n-grams), based on a specified number of words. These n-grams are unique combinations of consecutive words from each document.2. Create a Unique Word Segment List: After generating n-grams from all documents, we collect all unique n-grams and arrange them in a sorted list. This unique list will be used to track the presence and frequency of each n-gram in every document.3, Build a Document-Word Matrix: We create a matrix where each row represents a document, and each column corresponds to a unique n-gram from the list. The matrix counts how often each n-gram appears in each document.4. Normalize the Matrix: Optionally, we can adjust the counts in each document\'s row so they represent relative frequencies instead of raw counts. This step involves dividing each count by the total number of n-grams in that document, so each entry reflects a proportion of that document\'s n-grams. This makes comparisons across documents easier.A quick note to your debugging, you can print out each length of the list/cleaned words to see which step is going wrong. ", meta={'folders': ['hw8'], 'title': 'HW8 Problem 2', 'timestamp': '2024-11-03T22:28:23Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['hw8', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 134}),

I was told the autograder is run on Linux so for those running your code on any other systems, if you want to see what the autograder will see, try running your code on Linux first.If you are still not getting the README output, the second thing you need to do is to slightly adjust your tfidf before sorting it with argsort. You have to multiply each element by -1. This can be easily implemented (tfidf = -tfidf). Then sort it via argsort and you can find your largest 3 words by index [0,1,2].Note: Leave the sorting method as default (eg.

Yes, X is a 6 dim feature,so in that case you plot y  and y_hat against the sample index, i.e., you assign an index to each input sample.

I just need some starting point for that function because I don\'t necessarily understand what is supposed to be calculated through it. Thanks Answer: The input to the function is a list of sample values, which we\'ll denote by $$ \textbf{x} $$, and your task is to convert this list into a feature matrix, denoted by $$ \textbf{X} $$, up to a specified degree $$ d $$.Here\'s how the transformation should look:$$ \textbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{1}\\ x_{2}\\ \vdots\\ x_{N} \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \textbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{1}^{d} & x_{1}^{d-1} & \dots & x_{1}^{1} & 1 \\ x_{2}^{d} & x_{2}^{d-1} & \dots & x_{2}^{1} & 1 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ x_{N}^{d} & x_{N}^{d-1} & \dots & x_{N}^{1} & 1 \end{bmatrix} $$In other words, for each sample $$ x_i $$, you\'ll create a row in $$ \textbf{X} $$ containing the powers of $$ x_i $$ from $$ d $$ down to $$ 0 $$, with the final column as $$ 1 $$ to represent $$ x_i^0 $$.The instructions provided in the function skeleton outline this structure. To implement this, consider using a loop or a list comprehension to generate the matrix (in the form of a nested list). Both approaches can efficiently convert the list of values into the required feature matrix format.", meta={'folders': ['hw7'], 'title': 'Feature Matrix', 'timestamp': '2024-10-17T00:01:59Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['hw7', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 15}),

	Document(content="Question: Section 4 spent most of its class time today “reviewing” linear algebra when it is not a prerequisite to take the class. The CompE degree planner template doesn’t even take linear algebra until senior year (not sure about EE).I get confused by a lot that this class crams in while saying that it’s a review. The same thing happened with probability; my high school didn’t require a probability/stats class and neither does ECE before this class, but we “reviewed” it.

If we are expected to know a lot beforehand, why aren’t these topics part of our prereqs?  Answer: A full course in linear algebra covers deeper topics like proofs of spectral and singular value decompositions. We do not require that level of knowledge in this course, which is likely why linear algebra is not listed as a prerequisite. The Python notebook we covered goes over the elements of linear algebra required to understand regression, which at its heart, solves a linear system of equations. If you are concerned about your background in linear algebra, probability, and calculus, and you feel the reviews provided in the course are not sufficient, please chat with me during office hours.

There is a standard formula for the PDF of a Gaussian random variable with general mean and variance that can be found in the probability lecture slides. So, you just need to plug in \mu for the mean and \sigma^2 / n for the variance in that formula and write it down. Doing this yields the answer you see in the solutions.

From my interpretation of the slides, we should use the sample variance, but I am not sure if I am reading that right.Is it correct to then say that SE is just the standard deviation of the sample? (Looking at bullet point 3)From a procedural standpoint, when looking for SE (under the assumption we are under z-test conditions) we should first use the population variance / sqrt(n) to find SE.

For example, if the z-score is +2σ, you would use the fact that 95% of the values lie within ±2σ. This means 5% of the values lie outside this range, but since we are only interested in the right side (above +2σ), we take half of that remaining 5%, which is:   (1−0.95)/2=0.025", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'Exam question', 'timestamp': '2024-10-01T08:50:00Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['exam', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 122}),

	Document(content="Question: I\'m very confused on how we are supposed to find the mean of the distribution given the function that we are given in question 1.

Answer: It seems you are confused between what random variables are and what their realizations (or values) are. When we are given realizations/values, we calculate the mean by averaging the set of values. However, when we are given random variables with PDFs (or PMFs) rather than their realizations, there are theoretical formulae that determine their means (or expected values). Your instructor would have presented examples, beyond the slides, explaining how to carry out such calculations; they would have discussed both calculating the mean from PDFs, and determining the mean of the sample mean random variable. It is difficult to lay out the definition of expected value, its intuition (which is also needed in this problem), its key properties, and its relation to sampling distributions here, but it would be significantly easier to explain this theory in 10-min in person.

	Document(content="Question: Does it matter whether or not we reference the index of the box vector like it says in the readme or if we do it in another scaleable way that gets the right answer? For example, instead of indexing by doing box[len(box) - 1  - i] as suggested, I just made a copy of the list (i figured I shouldn\'t mess with the original list unless I\'m told I can), and used the .reverse() method to reverse the values in the list. This gives me the right answers to some extent. There are some float rounding errors but the readme said to expect those. Potentially unrelated to that, the second test case for problem 2 calculates the right numbers but with the wrong sign. All the numeric values are correct but all the signs are flipped which doesn\'t quite make sense because the first test case doesn\'t do this but still contains negatives. Here is the testing code provided (and I\'m pretty sure it\'s unchanged from the initial commit).    box_f2, width2 = create_box([-0.5, 0, 0, 0.5])    print(stencil(data, box_f2, width2))I\'m not sure if it\'s a problem with my logic or the test case but I\'ll keep digging until someone says the test case is backward.I suggest that the -0.5 and the 0.5 are backward because swapping their sign makes my test cases correct and because my logic doesn\'t (shouldn\'t) introduce any additional sign changes I\'m not sure what to make of this.Edit: fixed it. Turns out I wasn\'t using the reversed list so I flipped the signs but didn\'t affect the other cases because they are Palindromic. It appears that my methodology of indexing the box vector produces the right answer but my question still stands if there are any restrictions on doing it that way. another edit: A TA said in office hours that as long as the methodology works and I get the right answers it should be fine as long as it doesn\'t go against anything in the readme. Answer: As said in your edits, there doesn\'t seem to be many restrictions on -how- you get the correct answer.

Answer: I am not sure what precision the test cases are in but you probably could get away with solving this problem using the round() function. It takes the value you are rounding and a precision modifier so you can round it out to a large number of decimal points, but for this application, I think you can manage with like 5 or 6 decimal points of precision but floats can technically go to 17(?) or somewhere about.
