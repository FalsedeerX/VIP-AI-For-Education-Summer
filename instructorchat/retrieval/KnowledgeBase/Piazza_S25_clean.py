If your teammate failed to include you in the group submission, the system would treat it as if you did not submit the project.Furthermore, if this error was not submitted as a regrade request on Gradescope before the deadline, the score could not be updated.If you emailed someone about this over the weekend, please note that response delays are normal as people do not work weekends.

The denoising parameters that I\'m currently using are from the sklearn example from the link on the README documentation.

Does the noise value need to be set to a value of 10 for the poisoned data? I ask because this makes the numbers unrecognizable, which I imagine would make denoising very difficult. Answer: The sklearn KernelPCA example is a good reference: worth experimenting with parameter sweeps and visual comparisons to refine results.

The point value of each test case varies according to its difficulty level. If you believe there is an error in your grade, such as a score discrepancy between GitHub score and Brightspace score  (where the GitHub score is higher) or an approved homework extension that hasn\'t been accounted for, please submit a regrade request to ece20875.purdue.university@gmail.com. You have one week from the day the grades are posted on Brightspace to submit this request. You may submit regrade requests until 4.23.25. You will hear back from us on your regrade request by 4.30.25. When sending your regrade request, please ensure you include:A link to your GitHub repository (essential for homework assignments).Section Number.Grading item (e.g., Homework 8).Purdue email address (if the email isn\'t sent from a Purdue account).Detailed reasoning or justification for the regrade, specifically referencing the README.For regrade requests, please adhere to the following guidelines:Send a separate email for each homework.Use the subject line: \'HW# regrade request\'.", meta={'folders': ['hw8'], 'title': 'Homework 8 grades released!', 'timestamp': '2025-04-16T02:56:21Z', 'user': 'jlrfrndebx65v6', 'tags': ['hw8', 'instructor-note'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 174}),
	Document(content="Note: This note contains useful information on Exam 3, in the form of FAQ. Check here periodically for updates.When/where is the exam?05/09, 08:00 am - 9:00 am ET, Loeb Plyhs 1016 508 (One location for all sections).Sample exams: Previous semester exams and their corresponding solutions can be found in the \'Exam 3\' module within the content tab on Brightspace.Is the exam coordinated for all sections?Yes.What will be on the exam?There will be about 6 questions, covering weeks 12-16 of the course. Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics:kMeans clusteringGaussian mixture modelsInheritancekNNNaïve BayesLogistic regressionNeural networksWhat is the format/procedure of the exam?You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet. This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every question. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page.What materials am I allowed to bring?Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are not allowed, but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance.What is the best way to study for the exam?Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homeworks that have been assigned so far. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace.One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material.Will you take off points for syntax errors?If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax.What if I have a DRC accommodation?Please schedule an exam with the DRC Testing Center, and email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same.Note: Students have until 11:55 PM seven days before an exam to submit a request to the DRC Testing Center.Any other logistics to be aware of?There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you. Please try to arrive 10-15 min early to have enough time to find an appropriate seat. ", meta={'folders': ['exam', 'logistics'], 'title': 'FAQs for Exam 3', 'timestamp': '2025-04-16T02:50:26Z', 'user': 'jlrfrndebx65v6', 'tags': ['exam', 'instructor-note', 'logistics', 'pin'], 'likes': 2, 'views': 356}),

	Document(content="Note: This note contains useful information on Exam 2, in the form of FAQ. Check here periodically for updates.Check here periodically for updates.When is the exam?Monday, April 14 at 6:30-7:30 PM.Where is the exam being held?For Section 1: BHEE 129 - all students.For Section 2: BHEE 129 - students with last names (as registered on BrightSpace) beginning with A - R.PHYS 112 - students with last names(as registered on BrightSpace) beginning with S - Z.For Section 3: PHYS 112 - all students.These locations are confirmed as BHEE 129 and PHYS 112. Is the exam coordinated for all three sections?Yes.What will be on the exam?There will be about 6 questions, roughly covering weeks 6-11 of the course. Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics:Confidence intervals.Student’s t-distribution and t-tests.Regular expressions in Python.Linear regression, least squares equations, and evaluation metrics.Regularization and ridge regression.Cross validation.n-grams and tf-idf.Objects and classes.Sample Exams: Previous semester exams and their corresponding solutions can be found in the \'Exam 2\' module within the content tab on Brightspace.What is the format/procedure of the exam?You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet. This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every question. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page.What materials am I allowed to bring?Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are not allowed, but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance.What is the best way to study for the exam?Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homeworks that have been assigned so far. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace.One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material.Will you take off points for syntax errors?If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax.What if I have a DRC accommodation?Please schedule an exam with the DRC Testing Center, and email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same.Note: Students have until 11:55 PM seven days before an exam to submit a request to the DRC Testing Center.Any other logistics to be aware of?There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you.

	Document(content="Question: Hi this question is from fall 23 question 6c. Why do we use 0.95 where does that come from? Answer: The 3-sigma rule refers to the empirical rule in statistics, which tells us how data is distributed in a normal distribution:- 68% of the values lie within ±1 standard deviation (σ) of the mean.- 95% of the values lie within ±2σ of the mean.- 99.7% of the values lie within ±3σ of the mean.Now, applying this rule with the z-score from part b:When the question asks for a one-sided interval to the right of the mean, it\'s asking for the probability of finding values greater than a certain number of standard deviations. For example, if the z-score is +2σ, you would use the fact that 95% of the values lie within ±2σ. This means 5% of the values lie outside this range, but since we are only interested in the right side (above +2σ), we take half of that remaining 5%, which is:   (1−0.95)/2=0.025", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'practice exam fall 23', 'timestamp': '2025-02-28T22:59:54Z', 'user': '', 'tags': ['exam', 'student'], 'likes': 0, 'views': 157}),

You will not be permitted to take the exam in a different room than the one assigned to you. Is the exam coordinated for all three sections?Yes.What will be on the exam?There will be about 6 questions, covering weeks 1-6 of the course. Some questions will be on Python coding (either writing code segments or interpreting output of code), and others will be on data science. You can expect questions covering the following topics:Python data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)Basic Python operations (e.g., loops, arithmetic, manipulating data structures)Functions and higher order functions in PythonList comprehensions in PythonHistogramsRandom variables and probability distributionsSampling, the law of large numbers, and the central limit theoremHypothesis testingSample Exams: Previous semester exams (Fall 23 - Fall 24) and their corresponding solutions can be found in the \'Past Exams\' module within the content tab on Brightspace.What is the format/procedure of the exam?You will take this exam on printed paper with a pen/pencil, on an exam packet that we will provide to you. Your completed exam will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope, which we will use for grading and returning the exams to you. We will be leveraging Purdue’s Instructional Data Processing to have your exams uploaded. As a result, it is critical that you follow the exact template we have provided in the exam packet. This includes (1) writing all of your work on the exact sheet of paper provided for each question, and (2) writing your name and PUID at the top of every question. To facilitate this, the first 5 minutes of the exam will be used solely to fill out your name/ID on each page.What materials am I allowed to bring?Computers/tablets/calculators/electronic devices are not allowed, but other than that, the exam is open notes. You may bring hard copies of anything on Brightspace and may bring handwritten notes. You can also bring printed notes, e.g., a printed copy of a notebook you created or a PDF of notes you created. You are also allowed to bring a reference book (such as a Python reference book); however, we discourage this because we expect that looking anything up in a book might waste a lot of your time and negatively affect your overall performance.What is the best way to study for the exam?Go through all the lecture notes thoroughly. Then make sure you are comfortable with how to do the homework 1 - homework 5. Finally, take the practice exams posted on Brightspace.One suggestion is to create your own summary sheet / crib sheet that summarizes and synthesizes the lecture notes and/or homeworks. Often by creating something rather than merely looking at the notes, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material.Will you take off points for syntax errors?If the syntax error is trivial (e.g. missing a colon at the end of an if statement), we will only assess a minor penalty. If the syntax error is significant (e.g., you write a for loop without the “in” keyword or write a C-based for loop instead of Python for loop), we may assess more penalty because this may show a fundamental lack of understanding of the syntax.What if I have a DRC accommodation?Please schedule an exam with the DRC Testing Center, and email the instructor for your section if you have any questions. All other details will remain the same.Note: Students have until 11:55 PM seven days before an exam to submit a request to the DRC Testing Center.Any other logistics to be aware of?There are not assigned seats during the exam, but you should leave one seat between you and the people on either side of you. Please try to arrive 10-15 min early to have enough time to find an appropriate seat. ", meta={'folders': ['exam'], 'title': 'FAQs for Exam 1', 'timestamp': '2025-02-17T20:32:08Z', 'user': 'l8au4oyx6282lz', 'tags': ['exam', 'instructor-note', 'pin'], 'likes': 1, 'views': 355}),

	Document(content="Note: Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started: Ask questions!The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).Edit questions and answers wiki-style.Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors’ answer for instructors). Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above. Go anonymous.Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously. Tag your posts.It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag. Format code and equations.Adding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. Mathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation. View and download class details and resources. Click the Course Page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!Contact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at team@piazza.com.
